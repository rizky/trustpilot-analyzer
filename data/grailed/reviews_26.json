All 5 star reviews without comments have been altered by Admin accounts as the everyday user is required to leave a comment.\n\nHave a quick scan of the \u201cAdmin\u201d verified accounts and see how many reviews have no comments.\n\nOP:\nAfter buying and selling thousands of dollars worth of items on Grailed, I recently bought a shirt that was recommended as a \"Staff Pick\" by Grailed.\n\nI received the item and unfortunately for me,  it was not the size or condition as described in the item description. I contacted the Seller, with no response. Some days later, I contacted the Seller again, Paypal and Grailed. I received an instant response from the Seller acknowledging some \"flaws\" and a response from Grailed apologising the item was not as described. \n\nThe seller offers me $30 USD (the shirt was purchased for $400 USD). I stated that is not reasonable.\n\nOne day later, PayPal closes the case in favour of the seller, and Grailed changes my feedback from 2\/5 to 5\/5.\nIs this not against the purpose of a feedback system? \n\nGrailed falsely has changed my feedback, which will not warn other buyers of potential issues with this Seller.","title":"Grailed \"Staff Pick\" Flawed Item and False Overwritten Review.","stars":1,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-09-11","author":"NVmd","text":"Awful experience with Grailed. I sold a brand new pair of Golden Goose sneakers (username NVmd). The buyer filed a \"claim\" immediately after receiving the shipment saying the shoes were not in the box, which was not only a lie, it was a clearly pre-meditated strategy to get the shoes for free. Grailed did not inform me of the buyer's claim, and before I found out about it from PayPal, Grailed had already frozen my account. Grailed never responded to my email inquiry about this, and I wasn't able to speak to anyone because they don't have a phone number. \n\nGrailed allowed this buyer to literally STEAL a pair of $495 sneakers without providing any proof of what he was claiming! They didn't require him to communicate with me before filing a claim. They didn't inform me of his claim, and froze my account so I couldn't communicate with them once I found out the claim existed. They never gave me a chance to dispute the claim, or even to communicate with the buyer! And even though Paypal overturned their decision to refund the buyer after I gave them the evidence proving the shoes were in the box (photos, tracking info showing the package weight, my long history with eBay and PayPal without any claims like this against me, etc etc), I'm still locked out of Grailed.com. I have no way to communicate with the buyer, and Grailed still hasn't responded to my inquiry. \n\nGrailed allowed this buyer to commit legal THEFT, and even though PayPal ultimately sided with me, I wish I had the shoes back instead of the money. I'd be happier knowing that fraudulent behavior like this doesn't happen again, and that this despicable buyer learns that Grailed won't protect him like this in the future. Not only to did Grailed allow him to commit fraud and theft, they froze my account without even offering me a chance to respond. It's truly disheartening and terribly disrespectful.\n\nUpdate: Grailed posted a response to this review below, but they don't even realize that I can't respond here. It's laughably ironic because I tried inquiring to them directly, but they froze my account before I could do that. I sent an email to the general email address they advertise, but didn't get a response there either. \n\nTo \"Grailed Team\", perhaps you should spend less time freezing accounts and responding to reviews, and more time protecting your users. Also, my Grailed username is listed right in the above review. You must have read this too quickly, just like you froze my account too quickly without having all the relevant details.","title":"Awful experience... no protection against fraud!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-09-11","author":"Monique D","text":"Horrible experience!

I sold a belt  (shipping is out of your pocket as the funds arent released from paypal until the buyer gets the item) the buyer stated I sold a knock off which was bs and I have proof.

To minimize any miscommunication I am more than happy to screenshot these returned emails. \n\nYour response was highly disappointing. Your website is ridiculous when searching for answers with support. This review was not made out of ignorance. I\u2019ve never had so many buyers waste my time with their ability to submit offers with no obligation to pay. I\u2019ve had instances of fraud twice on your website and one where the seller cancelled to relist the item for more. That sends a very bad message to your clientele. The expectations you have set forth to prevent both are minimal in their efficacy. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting you mentioned sellers and buyers are encouraged to communicate because I have had conversations blocked after a seller shared his place of country with me. It was flagged as trying to sell off site yet if you even bothered to read the message, it sure wasn\u2019t. \n\nLet\u2019s get this straight. It\u2019s not a matter of not spending the time to look through the website for information. Let\u2019s not demean the customer experience. It\u2019s been nothing but issues with this site, multiple times with multiple transactions and I\u2019m not rookie to community selling. \n\nPicture this...\n\nAn eBay-esque site where there\u2019s no seller\/buyer protection, no commitment to buy when bidding, no accessible customer service and posting standards that are literally picked blindly out of a hat. See it? Then Grailed is your site! \n\nAs a seller, this site is a joke. They now require you to include pictures of your user name and date in every picture of your item. People can openly bid on your items and then don\u2019t have to commit to buy. It\u2019s a huge waste of time. The commission is ridiculous and shipping is at the cost of the seller in order to funds to be released. Well that sure deters fraud doesn\u2019t it? Take a page from Poshmark or eBay. \n\nAs a buyer, I\u2019ve come across fraud twice and you can only email them. They\u2019re so slow to respond and don\u2019t even monitor their site even though they have ridiculous terms and expectations for postings. There are so many postings that are inactive and sellers that you will never get ahold of. You\u2019ll have more luck gambling in Vegas than hoping the seller will actually respond to you. I have also had sellers cancel the sale and delist for more. Yep, they allow this. \n\nI have no idea how this site is still around. It\u2019s mission statement appears to be everything you can think to go wrong with a community marketplace. For a 10% commission, it\u2019s great not being able to call you.","title":"Picture this...","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-09-17","author":"Monique D","text":"This site is horrible!
