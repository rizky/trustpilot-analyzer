[{"date":"2020-09-02","author":"RT","text":"I ordered a Anti Social Social Club sweatshirt from the Grailed site for $131.00. The item was packed in a plastic bag making it hard to authenticate this sweatshirt. Once I got it and opened it up, it was clear it was fake. I contacted the company and let them know and included pictures. I got an email saying yes they did agree it was NOT authentic and then told me I had to go through Paypal to dispute the claim. The purchase did not go through Paypal it was from Grailed. They are a company that sells fakes and then uses a complicated system of hiding the purchase payment.  I have a screen shot of the sale and it is clear it came through Grailed. I have the item and all the emails as backup for my case. There are many complaints about this business on other websites, including Reddit,and SitJabber. This is not an isolated case.\n\nTo Grailed:  Love to hear from you! I have contacted you through the thread, we have been involved with, trying to sort this out.","title":"Fake Products\/Deceptive Payment\/Billing","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=11&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-03","author":"Richard Fredericks","text":"I can\u2019t see this marketplace lasting much longer.  We\u2019ve had three goes at Grailed, the first was, admittedly, fine, the third party seller we dealt with delivered.  \n\nThe second time, while the item we wanted was for sale, the seller was unable to accept payment via PayPal, which is the only real option given that there\u2019s no coverage or insurance for transactions that occur outside of PayPal.\n\nThe third time was just plain infuriating, and represented three weeks of apprehension and aggravation before I received back a refund.  The seller from whom I ordered an expensive item was largely unresponsive, and then finally when obliged by Grailed to respond, he fed us a line of BS concerning the order and how it was DHL\u2019s fault, even though he had not provided any confirmation of shipment or tracking number (even though he was supposed to provide both within 5 days of ordering, something he never did).  I contacted Grailed for assistance only to receive auto-responses.  Grailed simply shunted the problem over to PayPal, who take two more weeks to deliberate, and give the seller a chance to come through.  He never did, remained unresponsive as did Grailed, and so I spent almost three weeks wondering if I\u2019d been ripped off.  And the seller in question, who\u2019s caught a string of negative reviews, is still selling on Grailed.  There\u2019s integrity for you.  Moreover, if you wait to post a review against a Grailed seller until after you receive a refund through PayPal, Grailed removes that option.\n\nGrailed is just too much of a crapshoot to trust.  Avoid.","title":"Three weeks of Aggravations","stars":2,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=11&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-04","author":"Yunus","text":"Hi Grailed.

I\u2019ve been buying and selling on grailed since 2015. They constantly turn their back on users who have been using their platform for a long time. They could care less how great your feedback is or how many sales you have , they will side with the buyer 10000% of the time. Their customer support is atrocious , similar to stockx, you never get the help you\u2019re looking for and it takes days\/weeks to get a mere response. They don\u2019t allow users to connect on different platforms because they\u2019re so greedy they will ban you if they think you\u2019re not using their platform to sell your items just so they can steal 10% of your sale.
