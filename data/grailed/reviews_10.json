I have actually purchased this product originally through Grailed from the seller shellystrick4l which you can contact to confirm(He has been more helpful than the Grailed Team). I have also even posted a screenshot of my paypal transaction to show authentication and seller's receipts (Attached from emails I sent).\n\nI have tried to relist this product several times, but the authentication team at Grailed has deemed this item inauthentic several times now. I tried to relist it because I notice sometimes you guys don't officially list some items until 2 or 3 attempts of relisting. I posted Grailed's request by providing screenshots of receipts, one is my paypal transaction directly from Grailed and the second attempt the seller's Nike receipt confirmation. I find it ridiculous how the item is just deemed inauthentic with no clear reasons and I even purchased this product through Grailed which is baffling to me. How is it my account is frozen when I am relisting an item that I bought through Grailed. If you guys can not give me a clear reason why my account it frozen and this item is truly a counterfeit, then I want to request a full refund for the Jordan union 4 which I have purchased from Grailed.","title":"Account Frozen and Authentication ISSUE","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=10&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-17","author":"George","text":"9 percent...","title":"9 percent...","stars":1,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=10&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
