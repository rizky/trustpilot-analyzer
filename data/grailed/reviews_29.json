They were sent at the end of May and were so badly stiched and put together, that maybe they come from a 2nd hand bargain Cheapest place. They also had a whole in the back (by the belt). He paid $ 75 of his hard earned money as a teen. The Support from Grailed was allegedly escalated last July 15th with NO response from Paypal as he was instructed to do. We are in Canada and he has so far lost on the shipping expense as well  since no feedback response has come. I took to helping him as I want this matter .\nresolved and not have him tossed aside by unscrupulous sellers. We brought this to the attention of Grailed a while back. The seller has resorted to being verbally abusive and  frankly he can barely spell. His childlike writing leaves much to be desired, yet he sells often (from reviews). He has had quite a mix of reviews...yet for us it did not work out. I have the mercahndise sitting right next to me now. Envelope and all. If only grailed could answer and keep their word up (By Wyatt @ Support last July 15th 2019) . Any suggestions> There is no Phone  # to reach Grailed either that I can see.\n\nUPDATE#1 : Both my son and I keep getting standarized answers with a code # attached to them in Emails, yet no one answers to the questions. It has been 2 months of waiting. Paypal, to whom Grailed directed us to, is not responding as well. I am very dissappointed and sad for my son who works minimun wage in a hot kitchen to make this purchase. Since Grailled is the body that works with the sellers, one would think that they would step up to honor the situation and help to restore funds back to my son. The seller ( Jade Green) is a dark and abusive person.....My son would sell the jeans to a friend at the risk of the losing his friendship over how poorly done this jeans were custom- stiched. Grailled, Please help.\n\nUPDATE #2...Still after countless emails, we still get a generic answer with a # attached to it. Only Wyatt (Support) so far seems to have been a bit more engaging.yet that was days ago.  Paypal has not responded to my son....and we still have these pair of 'not as described' pair of ill put together jeans. I can see how a much younger person, would give up with Grailled unresponsiveness...yet thank God for caring moms who will see to it that a resolution is reached. I wish I could get feedback or help from some of the reviewers here......Grailled, please answer. Please.\n\n**UPDATE 3**...We still are to resolve this matter from the end of May.So that is 2 + months now. Am I to publish my son's email and user name publicly here as 'Grailled' requested it in this forum?? I emailed them directly. The problem also is in having 'Paypal' help me help my son. What to do next?? The thing is that the 'Updates' as recommended by 'Trust Pilot' are not getting Grailled's attention as their original answer has been the same: No change\n\nUpgrade # 4...I figured Grailed's emails and responses for the past 2 months. They create a \"Ticket#\" which changes for each email, hence it does not reflect a genuine answer to your case at all. IT IS 100% GENERIC or FIXED.  Even when a Support person's name is given out, that 'person' has no  'knowledge' of your case by the next response. It will refer to you as the 'purchaser' or the' seller' equally. They also create different Subject lines and print the same content on separate emails.  This company needs to be reported with Better Business Bureau, or its equivalent, in USA. They pray on the young who, for some, might be inclined to let go and move on.

He also explained why the company relies on PayPal as well as their authentication processes. This is how the case should've been handled from the get go.\n\nI applaud Grailed and particularly Nico for taking the right steps in addressing my issues which have made this experience better. While I can't sincerely give a 5 star review based on the earlier experience, I'm updating my rating from 1 to 3 stars given the resolution and Grailed's earnest attempts to amend the situation.\n\nI'll leave my points of feedback that I sent to Grailed for everyone to see so they know what the current situation is and hopefully what the future may be should Grailed implement more support and control over the process to prevent fraudulent sellers and handle situations that do slip through.\n\n1. A clearer explanation of the the process in your FAQs to get refunded and support should cases such as this happen\n2. A customer service phone line or live chat where customers don't have to wait a full day for an email response. I think it took far too many days to get the proper support I needed\n3. Customers shouldn't be sent canned responses if their questions require different responses (i.e. authentication or refund questions that are outside of the PayPal $30 reimbursement).\n4. Transparency about your authentication guarantee and what that means. \n\n\n-------------------------Original Review------------------------------------\nI purchased a really expensive bag after doing research and reading how Grailed 1) checks for authenticity and 2) Offers total buyer protection and guarantees to help you get your money back if you're sold a fake. Unfortunately I've learned that all of this is just lip service and basically the only thing you can do is go through PayPal.\n\nWhen I received the bag, it was clear the seller sent me a bag that was completely different from the bag in his original picture and clearly counterfeit. First note that Grailed doesn't have any phone number, you can only email in and they always take at minimum a full day to respond. Secondly, they send you to PayPal and basically the resolution is for you to ship the item at your OWN expense to get a refund. After many days of back and forth(ticket #93117) , Grailed's own moderators have deemed the item inauthentic. That being said, all they've done is frozen the seller's account. What a punishment, the seller probably doesn't even care, he not receiving any financial punishment for being a malicious seller. Once they get this fake item back, I'm sure they'll just go and try to scam another buyer again.\n\nOn my end, I have to now ship the item back from the USA to the Netherlands and PayPal will only reimburse $30. The shipping is going to cost over $100 to insure, and add signature confirmation. I've sent Grailed 3 emails specifically (ticket # 93117) asking how to get this shipping refunded and they keep sending me canned responses to ask Paypal event though I've already mentioned the $30 limit on the shipping reimbursement (which I confirmed with PayPal on the phone). Honestly, Grailed does NOT protect you at all. All the onus is going to be on the buyer... YOU Have to return the item... PAY for return shipping.. .be OUT of money on the return shipping...YOU talk to PayPal..... Grailed's whole thing about how they guarantee Authenticity is a lie . Their customer service is non existent... highly suggest you avoid Grailed and go with other services that actually stand on their word about authenticity and actually do something to protect the buyer. Otherwise, be prepared to likely get a fake item and then be out the shipping cost that you're going to have to spend to return the item.","title":"Updated (resolved) - Worst buying experience.
