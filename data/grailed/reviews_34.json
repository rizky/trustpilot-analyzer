Completely unprofessional service, customer service is ridiculous and mostly automated, you get banned for no reason while the OG admins of grailed can do whatever they want. Try to link your instagram to a post and see what happens. And then look at how the top sellers can promote their twitter, insta, venmo, etc. Fck grailed and fck the customer service.

They will not check to see if anything is real or fake so the items you receive are not 100% authentic. THE SITE IS FLOODED WITH FAKES. Great news for the buyers is that Grailed automatically blocks anyone accused of selling a fake. Sad news is for a seller one person having buyers remorse and just wants his money back he can just say they were fake. The seller instantly banned and no guarantee from grailed that you get your product back. Great news for the buyer is if you always wanted a pair or turtle doves to flex on Instagram you can just buy them wear them for what you need then a month later still get your full refund and possibly get to keep the shoes.

Grailed has absolutely no way of talking with someone. They tell you to email them but all you get is one response (via email- computer generated) per day type service. No actual person to ever have a normal conversation with. I do not reccomend this website for high end products or customers that want an interactive experience with qualified staff and owner's who care about the integrity of there business . If you have cheap stuff or are looking to buy possibly replica, fake  products than Gailed may be more suitable for you.\n\nThere seller was trying to sell me fake Balenciaga runners. After i realized that and confronted them(of course via email) they concluded the shoes where real... Except by the time they finally got back to me ( way over 24 hrs) i had already gathered enough evidence for a slam dunk case to prove that the shoes are a total knock off..not impressed by there \"staff of authentication specialist\" do yourself a favor, do business with businesses that have a phone numbers and people who you can talk to. If something goes wrong with your sale or purchase on Grailed, prepare to be disappointed.\n\n***UPDATE****\n\nI've emailed Grailed at least 10 times with more evidence and my case number... if there reply was anything other than lip service they'd know this.  Don't be fooled as the other reviewers have claimed, absolutely no actual substance behind there reply. Saving face that's it.  \nI am speaking with news channel 10 my local station regarding this transaction. They were very receptive to know more about the process and nuances of doing business with this company.\n\n***Second update... complete and utterly disgraceful service. Grailed's reply is a computer generated automated response. No substances no intention to actually help. Stay away from this site if you dont want to loose your money\n\n****UPDATE 3\/20\/2019\nStill no resolution, Grailed still has my money in limbo. Worst of all, i still haven't gotten any correspondence from Grailed. \n**DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE YOU PUT ANYTHING OF VALUE ON THIS WEBSITE***,","title":"Probably the most horrific experience\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=34&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-03-08","author":"WesWestCuhh","text":"Grailed is terrible I recommend you stay far away.","title":"Grailed is terrible I recommend you\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=34&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
