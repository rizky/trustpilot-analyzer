Had some good experiences, but also very bad. Ended up with fake goods where Grailed did not give a damn. Been sent the wrong goods where Grailed also did not give a damn. They only suggest you go to Paypal with your problems. Their limited staff do not have the expertise, experience or knowledge to know what is genuine. Their knowledge probably starts and stops at Yeezy or Supreme. \n\nWhen you are a seller you can't have proper interaction with customers because Grailed are so paranoid you might be trying to do an off-site transaction, so they keep sending you red warnings. So all communication needs to be kept cold and basic. It's not possible to build a relationship with a consumer.\n\nAs a seller you are continually dealing with cheap buyers who want everything for a few dollars. You get constantly messed about. All communication from buyers is \"lowest price?\" \"deal?\" \"trade?\". There's no proper form of language or attempt to construct a sentence. And even when you agree on a price they do not pay. It's truly the most miserable website to try and sell on.\n\nAnd then you have Grailed moderators who pull your items for pathetic reasons for clothing they have no knowledge about. Have you bothered to look at the Grailed Team Instagram account ? They are kids barely able to grow proper body hair. What is their background and knowledge to be able to know anything about what's sold on Grailed ? They know Off-White but they couldn't tell you anything about Chanel or real fashion houses. They have heard of Balenciaga, but could not tell you anything about the house and its codes. I doubt they know the Christian name of Balenciaga without searching google. These are kids that probably only know about streetwear and have worn VANS. \n\nTake some advice, use other websites to sell on. Build your own website on Shopify. Take care of your own business. Don't waste your time trying to use a platform run by les enfants. There's no good reason to support a business like Grailed if they do not care about their sellers or buyers. It's far too easy to claim \"we care about your trust and safety\". Hollow meaningless words. They do not care about anything apart from their profit margins.\n\nThe following is nonsense written on the Grailed website :-\n\nOur expert moderators work around the clock to review and verify listings posted on Grailed for authenticity. We ensure that the items we review are Authentic. We check labels, patterns, textiles, and many other details to make sure items are the real deal and remove items that are likely to be fake.\n\n\"Our expert moderators\". What makes anyone at Grailed an expert on anything ? Their les enfant staff are not old enough or experienced enough. \n\n\"We remove items that are likely to be fake\". So why is Grailed littered with fakes ?\n\nThe whole Grailed website and its les enfants staff and moderators are a joke.","title":"Grailed = more bad reviews than good.","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=17&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-04-30","author":"pnam jayrat","text":"My account has been frozen for a non-sense reason \u2018listing inauthentic items\u2019 by ignorant moderators \n\nI replied back to the email and sent to appeal as instructed on 24 April but haven\u2019t received any response.\n\nI asked if they could provide me with more details on why my account has been frozen when all of my items are authentic.

I have about 10 sales and have purchased multiple times from this website.  They've been picky in the past and some features are annoying.  First, my account gets like this shadow ban whenever I try to reach out to my customer.  But once the customer put the email in the chat not me.  Another time, it sent the error but all mentioned in the chat was how the item came from somewhere else.  The thing that really made me mad was how recently I purchased this pair of Balenciaga Speed Trainers from jomashop.com.  They got flagged as fake and it was weird.  I filed an appeal and showed the ORIGINAL RECEIPT and they still said it was fake.  It was clear the email was paid no attention to as they said \"Our moderators have removed the infringing listing and will be taking appropriate action. Thank you for bringing this listing to our attention!\"  This was my own appeal! A companies true values really show in their customer service and this one really let me down.  I've brought my business to them for many times in the past.  Along with that, there are some great buyers who are understanding, but there are low-ballers who think they know more than you and try to make your item seem worthless.  Some buyers refuse to chat and even when you ship within 5 days they will leave a 1star review on how you're slow.
