But after a few days the seller decided he did not want to ship anymore to outside US and unilaterally cancelled the deal, and simply refunded my purchase price. When I insisted he ships the item because a deal was made, he laughed and said I could not \u201cforce\u201d him to sell to me. \n\nThis is grossly disappointing. Grailed is a site for hard to get authentic and unique items - that is its entire value proposition. But Grailed does nothing to ensure that a seller honors a deal that has been struck and fully paid for. Just as buyers cannot change their minds, similarly should be expected of sellers - else don\u2019t list the item with shipping to specific regions! \n\nGrailed customer service responded with a curt and officious email - \u201cUnfortunately per our terms of service, sellers reserve the right to refund a transaction with or without reason at their own discretion.\u201d \n\nThis was a disappointing experience because the item was meant to be a special birthday gift for a loved one, now that has discouraged me from buying anymore from Grailed.","title":"Poor buyer protection to get seller to honor deals","stars":1,"location":"SG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=27&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
