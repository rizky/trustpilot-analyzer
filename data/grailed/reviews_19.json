I NEVER resisted an item after being told it was inauthentic besides when grailed emailed me TELLING ME TO RELIST with \u201ctagging\u201d or a \u201cclearer picture\u201d *at this point grailed didn\u2019t officially say that the item was inauthentic* (i just assumed that grailed needed more pics not that they were telling me that my item was fake!). Can you guys PLEASE reconsider being this harsh on me and at least let me BUY ONLY on the app?? This was literally a MISTAKE! Could you guys give the benefit of the doubt to a customer of 4 YEARS when i tell you guys that I really had no idea that the items were inauthentic? I know listing inauthentic items is against TOS but i\u2019m convinced that most of the items we\u2019re indeed authentic. (I might even be able to find email receipts from the web store that some of the items were bought from). Even if they did happen to be inauthentic i promise you guys that I had absolutely NO KNOWLEDGE of this. Another thing that astonished me is that in grailed\u2019s response to my original review they told me that i\u2019ve listed multiple fake bape pieces as well as various other brands but the ONLY bape peice i ever posted WAS SOLD AND HAD A DIGITALLY AUTHENTICATED BADGE from you guys and was never taken down! This really makes no sense to me, I really hope you can reconsider because this isn\u2019t the way to treat a loyal customer that made a simple mistake. The fact that I believed that items that I bought on grailed were authentic and felt no need to legit check them before posting shouldn\u2019t be held against me. If the item wasn\u2019t taken down from the original seller I bought it from on grailed then why should it be taken down when I relist! You guys didn\u2019t even give me a single warning before deciding to completely perm ban me. All I ask for is 1 more chance, i assure you guys that this kind of misunderstanding will never happen again. Again my usernames are @_alealeale and @alessandrov\nBy the way: I also ended up GETTING RID OF THESE ITEMS through a different app so you won\u2019t ever have to worry about me relisting any of those pieces (that you guys claim are \u201cinauthentic\u201d) on Grailed.\nThanks For Your Time","title":"Grailed Refuses To Unban Me When I\u2019ve Done Nothing Wrong","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=19&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-03-14","author":"Paul","text":"This website seems so cool at first, so many cool items listed there. A few weeks ago, I purchased from their platform for the first time, a vintage Moncler ski jacket. The listing mentioned \"size WOMENS L\" but I didn't really care, the measurements were good for me and the jacket looked cool, not feminine at all. Once I received it, I didn't like it as much as I did in the pictures. The seller doesn't want it back, that's fair. I decide to relist it. One day later, Grailed sends me an email telling me they removed it because it's womenswear. Lol this seems completely moronic to me. I was able to purchase an item on this website that was not flagged and removed by their curators, so I expect to be able to resell it on that very same platform if I want to. I didn't change a single word from the first listing when I tried to resell it, so it's really beyond me why they didn't take it down a loooong time ago if it was against their rules. What an amateurish job. \n\nObviously I contacted the customer service. Two weeks ago for the first time, and a few times since. Never heard back once from them. \n\nI wish I had read the some of the reviews here before I took a chance with them ! Well, you live and you learn. I'm never going near that website ever again :D.\n\nEDIT - Thanks for the reply. My username is richeverland683. At this point I kinda expect you're gonna tell me you can't do anything, but it feels a little bit less frustrating to finally hear from you.\n\nEDIT EDIT - I changed my one star rating to a 3 star one, since they corrected their mistake.

I decided to then write a trust pilot review to try to get a response and I pretty much just got a robot response saying they won't urban me for selling fakes (and relisting them multiple times) *WHICH I NEVER DID*. I had multiple 5 star reviews and many of the items I was selling had a \"digitally authenticated\" badge from grailed. I'm convinced that these items were not fake (I might even be able to find old receipts from when I bought them). I've been buying and selling on grailed for 4 years and this is how they treat me :\/ worst support i've ever seen in my life.

First of all, I had no idea these items were inauthentic and I said this to grailed. They refuse to give a loyal customer of 4 years 1 more chance even when I said that I would stop selling on the app and that all I wanted to do from now on is buy. I am also positive that not all of these items are inauthentic because (as indicated in grailed's response to me) I had listed a fake supreme piece. This makes no sense because the only supreme piece I ever posted on there was bought directly from the supreme web store *supreme x north face metallic logo hoodie*. I know that writing this review probably won't do anything but get me a useless \"we are not able to reinstate your account\" reply but I'm writing it anyway because think this is just unfair. I didn't even know I was doing anything wrong and I didn't even get a single warning. I never relisted ANY of these items unless grailed asked me for a clearer picture of a specific part of the garment. I don't understand what they get out of being ridiculously harsh on loyal customers that spend thousands of dollars MONTHLY on their app. This is just unfair... I would understand a ban of a few weeks or even a few months but a PERMANENT ban over a single mistake is just stupid. I don't see what the harm is in giving me one more chance or banning me from SELLING on the app while letting me continue to buy. You guys also just need to add more support in general (for example: a line that people can call where you actually talk to someone *not some prerecorded voicemail*). This used to be my favorite app for shopping. I'm very disappointed in grailed and their team they've really let me down :\/\n\nI also already sold all of these items on a separate app so I really have no need to continue selling on grailed.\n\n I even offered to try to find PROOF of authenticity for some of these items but all they did Is give me the same pre-written response as always. smh... at least give me a chance","title":"No Second Chances (even for simple mistakes)","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=19&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-03-20","author":"Igor \u201cLait\u201d","text":"I sell on grailed since 2017.My account has been blocked.
