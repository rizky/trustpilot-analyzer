[{"date":"2020-12-25","author":"former grailed admin","text":"This platform is corrupt & the admins are thirsty for power. Without question Grailed has the actual worst customer service I have ever encountered; combining this with the recent x2 increase in fees and the way they have consistently ignored their user-base has been a major factor in my move. They alienated a once vital seller-base which has resulted in only a handful of decent sellers with worthwhile items remaining. For a superior alternative I wholly recommend Jawnflip.","title":"Greed & Capitalism","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-12-29","author":"Pierre Chaquin","text":"Very weird.

Well at first the removed them because they were supposably blurry then I took more time out of my day to post more clear photos and of every symbol and origin of each ring, then they removed it because they said they determined after reviewing my listing that they were unauthentic and they don't tolerate inauthentic items and I kept reposting them because that's a lie it's not my fault that they are unexperienced and just because something is in hyped in the first thing on the market the people go to and see a lot of the item that they can't determine if it's real or fake I feel that I've been wrongly punished am I count's been frozen because of this I would like my account reinstated please thank you my username is ( RIICARDI )","title":"Frozen account for Little to no reason!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-01-04","author":"Jj","text":"My account has been frozen due to \u201cunshipped items\u201d but I had agreements with my buyers.. which didn\u2019t actually matter as I had few days left to ship my items anyway!

I tried to list a few items (authentic Chanel accessories) and all of them were removed with the reason given \"inauthentic replica\". Seriously? I've been selling for ages with a long track record\u00a0on Vestiaire Collective, for example, where all listings are pre-moderated and physically inspected after the items are sold. Never ever even one of them was found to be inauthentic, not even mentioning the fact that a few of my items I tried to list for sale on Grailed had original receipts. Having\u00a0said that, I seriously doubt the professionalism of those who moderate the website. Shall there be an issue between the buyer and seller - how are they going to determine what is not a replica? Would there be any seller protection or it is going to be something like eBay - non existent? I guess it will be an automatic rip off of the seller - no item and no money given the level of expertise. Unbelievable.","title":"Doubt their professionalism and seller protection","stars":1,"location":"SG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
