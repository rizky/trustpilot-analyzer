I've been a seller of grailed since 2016 with 100 successful 5 star review a and over 130 transaction. I've never had any intention to tarnish my account over some petty rings. You guys really think highly of you client!. SMH I recall having a bad experience where a seller ripped me off and u did absolutely nothing about. Now here I am after 4 months writing reviews after reviews trying to get help trying to reinstate my account because I understand sometimes there's mistaking judgement, after all this time contacting your help service trying to reach out here and it turns out you guys are completely ignoring me. I understand at this very point in time that you guys are full of Shot. It isn't my fault that your moderators are clowns and can't Authenticate everything becuz of lack of experience, okay yeah but punishing me with out any proof is B.S. I'm also following up with my lawyer regarding this, it is illegal to remove someone without any history of such scamming or any proof of any unauthentic items. I feel discriminated against also.","title":"Discriminated against by grilled and ignored","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=6&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-23","author":"raketa shop","text":"I don't know whats happened, my account has banned \"for fraudulent activity\".

I'm very disappointed that grailed has frozen my account claiming I sold inauthentic items yet all the items I've sold have been authenticated by you guys.

He agreed and then later decided to claim for a refund which I refunded in full. Then this morning I just get this notification saying my account is frozen without any further explanation, yes you have a protection system but how am I the seller not being protected and having my account frozen at will fair? My funds are on hold, its been 1 month yet I've shipped all my items and included tracking details.

I spent 2 years building my business online and gaining credibility & good ratings in the seller\/buying community.  I had a 5 star seller rating and held all 3 of their seller badges including \u201cTrusted Seller\u201d. All that comes crashing down in a moment, without justification or cause.  My account was blocked without cause and they refuse to provide and information and won\u2019t return my email as well as there is no phone support.

The pics and description looks legit (the seller said that he bought them from the local Neimans Marcus), but turns out the US XS-sized sweater (marketed and sold as XS sweater) is actually clearly a knockoff sweater from China (I found a hidden XL label). Aside from this super obvious proof, the material and smell of the sweater is completely off as I am very familiar with these Chinese knockoff sweaters. For people who don't know, many XL labelled Asian-sized Chinese knockoff sweaters fit like a US XS,S,M etc. depending on the item.\n\nSo, with the solid proof of a tagged XL label, I sent many photos to the customer support team (the person who responded to me had the first name Kevin) to inform them that this item is 100% not authentic. However, after several days, they simply got back to me, saying that it is authentic. When I asked them repeatedly how do they explain the XL tag (I get they can't really tell things like material from the photos), there was ZERO answer on that, and they kept avoiding that question with zero sense of responsibility. There was no explanation why they stand by it being authentic.\n\nThis incident makes me think, if even with a SOLID 100% photographed proofs with the XL tag, they can't even do their job right and take stern action, how would they be able to tell other fake items apart, that are made without obvious flaws that cannot be photographed such as this?\n\nLong story short, Grailed \"authentication services\" and \"zero tolerance policy on fake items\" is complete nonsense. I am sharing this story here so buyers and consumers can be more aware and think twice before using Grailed. Seems to me that Grailed is just being completely irresponsible, lazy, and don't want to deal with issues like these. And know this, Grailed, by being complacent and lazy, you ARE supporting counterfeit goods.\n\nTLDR: Grailed is a scamming company that support counterfeit goods. Their \"digital authentication\" and \"zero tolerance policy\" towards fake product is complete BS. Don't use them.","title":"Grailed (scam site) digitally authenticated a 100% fake item I purchased, then refused to take action after customer support is contacted","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=6&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
