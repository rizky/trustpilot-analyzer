Unknowingly i sold an inauthentic item, and the buyer opened a case on it and i immediately accepted the return. I have made over 70 transactions and have a 4.5 star review on my account. We do not sell inauthentic items but one slipped through the cracks, and as im sure everybody has made mistakes before in the past unintentionally. not to mention this situation has only happened 1 time, and they are going by the buyers words. What if in a different situation the buyer is just trying to scam? I emailed grailed numerous times and explained to them the whole situation and its been over 48 hours without any response. If its not for this issue grailed would be a 5 star app. They should definitely give second or even third chances, especially to sellers with good feedback on numerous transactions.","title":"Grailed is such a good platform to sell\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=33&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-03-14","author":"Mustafa Babar","text":"Terrible, didn't even last 3 minutes on the website.
