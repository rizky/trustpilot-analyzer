After being frozen, I received an email that encouraged me to contact the support team to appeal the  frozen account if there was a mistake.\n\nI sent an email asking what exactly got my account frozen (no specific product was deemed \u201cinauthentic\u201d) just to get a seemingly automated response that stated how there is no chance for my account to be unfrozen and that there will be no further responses to my appeal messages. They didn\u2019t even read my first message, and once I sent a follow-up I received the exact same message signed by a \u201cLexi\u201d from Grailed support, which I suspect to be a fake name for an automated response. I felt very restricted from receiving the support that I am entitled to as a user on their platform.\n\nGrailed support considers its users just another number in their statistics, with no real support to help with issues such as this. Grailed has been a great platform for me as a reseller for many years, I had built a strong reputation with an overall 4.7 star rating from my 10+ reviews and 15+ sales, which was cut short from my account being frozen. It was very frustrating for me to lose my account so suddenly.\n\nI even had a pending order from a purchase I made off another Grailed user, which was interrupted from my account termination and I have yet to be able to track my order which I already paid for prior to the account freezing.\n\nGreat platform for buyers and sellers, very poor user support. If it wasn\u2019t for my bad experience, I would have rated the platform 4 or 5 stars rather than the 2 star rating I decided upon. Do not depend on the support team to solve your issues, they likely will not help.","title":"Very Poor Support Team","stars":2,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-16","author":"Yana Capps","text":"This is horrible site with horrible policy.

Later on I found one for like 18$ and one on some Chinese website for a couple of dollars. \nThere is no return possible because the picture matches what I've got. But the quality... Facepalm.

Until one of my favorite brands (Visvim) did not fit.  The size was correct, but the shoes were way too small.  I expected better quality control with Visvim (the shoes were tagged Made in Japan).  I agree with sellers that it is wickedly tricky to measure the inside of a shoe--this is distinct from garments that are more easily measured.  Unfortunately, I bought two pairs at almost the same time and none fit--shame on Visvim.  According to Grailed, if the seller will not accept a return then the buyer should sell the item.  Some of us have never sold anything and don't know how to do it.  That's why we are buyers.","title":"No recourse for buyer if an item doesn't fit","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-06-05","author":"Nicolas Girod","text":"Human experience has decreased so much... have been using grailed for years.
