First, the positives. Once your item sells and you Input the tracking you get paid. Now for the negatives. Constant emails about lowering price on products! Maybe if you lower your selling fees than I could price my items better! Next, there authentication process. I was emailed and warned about selling a replica supreme tee. If I did it again I would be banned. Now I bought and have the same tee in different colours and sizes and knew they were all authentic! They were all listed on grailed with no issues! Knowing my item wasn't a replica i relisted the item on grailed. Guess what?! It was authenticated and deemed legit! Love that consistency right? I had to contact there customer service to take that strike off my account because i didnt want to be banned if this ever happened again. They asked for all this proof of this and that. I told them to look at my listing that was deemed counterfeit and the listing that was up on grailed. All the same pictures and deemed authentic!  After 10 exchanges they said I shouldnt have  negative mark on my account. Another annoying thing about grailed is when your messaging with a potential buyer you will get pop ups about warning you that selling off site doesnt protect you or you could get banned or something like that when the messaging you're having with a buyer or seller has nothing to do with that. Grailed should find a different was with informing there buyers or sellers rather threatening them with being banned. It doesnt make us feel good and makes them look even more foolish when they're wrong. Hopefully I dont get banned from there overly sensitive customer service team for this review.","title":"Updated review of grailed","stars":2,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=14&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-06-10","author":"Trenten Ratchford","text":"Hello, I recently just sold an item and the dude I sold it too was harassing me (mind you same day of him purchasing the item) I then decided I didn\u2019t wanna do business with him so I refunded him and I was going to put it up again and Grailed kept taking it down (assuming dude got mad that I refunded and kept reporting it was unauthentic or something ) so I just stopped trying to repost and I got the email super late explaining that they took it down do to it being \u201cunauthentic\u201d yet it was up on Grailed for a week and I sold it no problem because it was REAL and I had proof but I\u2019m assuming the dude That was harassing me and I refunded reported it cause he was salty I didn\u2019t wanna do business with him!

We first heard about Grailed this year and after reading their terms of service, we signed up to sell on the platform. In all honesty, I was impressed with the platform however similar to others, our account was frozen for listing inauthentic items despite our items being genuine.\n\nWe have listed and sold these same items on multiple e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Bonanza, eBay) without being accused of listing inauthentic items.\n\nTo add to the confusion, we currently have active transactions on Grailed which we have not been able to access since our account was frozen.\n\nI proceeded to contact Grailed through email and their initial response states \"the account was frozen for listing counterfeit items.\" While I understand Grailed has to maintain a safe community for it's customers, they have blatantly disregarded the seller and failed to provide a clear explanation of which items were supposedly counterfeit.\n\nIn summary, if you are a seller:\n- Potential to be a good platform for selling men's fashion\n- It's very likely you will be accused of listing inauthentic items at some point.\n- Your account will likely be frozen.\n\n\nI will be sure to provide an update if our account is reinstated.\n\n\n**Update 1: \nThanks for the response. Our username is Timeford.\n\n\n**Update 2: \nI sent an email to Grailed as suggested and their response was... \"the items listed are counterfeit\". \n\nI have received the exact same response each time. \n\nI've raised a few questions in my messages to Grailed and none of them have been answered.  There's been no further explanation of the issue and it seems like our message is being ignored as we have seen this exact same response to other reviews on trust pilot.\n\nIf you decide to use this platform to sell, be prepared to have your account frozen for listing counterfeit items. It doesn't matter if your items are authentic as this doesn't seem to impact the decision made by Grailed. \n\nIf you're looking to sell on Grailed, save yourself the trouble and list your items on another platform.","title":"An honest review of our experience selling with Grailed.","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=14&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-06-11","author":"Mrs Burton","text":"My account has been frozen with no explanation in the middle of a transaction...\nThis has made me look dishonourable to the seller who I have been messaging for the last 2 days.

Guest Checkout purchases are not protected by PayPal.\" There is no mention of Grailed's own 100% money-back guarantee in that disclaimer.\n\nPaypal is not Grailed. You are not Paypal. Paypal's policy is not reflective of your own policy that you advertise on your site.\n\nAt the very least, since you won't assist in getting my money back as promised by the copy on your website, you should change that text to be clear for other customers so this doesn't happen to them. I'm not sure why you wouldn't do that unless you're actively trying to mislead people about your policy.\n\nI've had a really good experience for years on your website otherwise, which is why this is so frustrating and disappointing.\n\n--------\n\nI ordered something over a month ago that never arrived, and tracking stopped at the end of May, so I have to assume the package is lost. I - apparently - used PayPal guest checkout when I purchased because I can't find the transaction on my Paypal account (which I find odd since I'm permanently signed in, and I do have the receipt with the transaction ID).\n\nJordan at Grailed customer service is telling me it's not covered because I used guest checkout, and I have pointed out that the website advertises:\n\n\"Every purchase on Grailed is protected by our 100% money-back guarantee.\"\n\nAnd that: \"Orders that never arrive, inauthentic items, and items not as described will be refunded\u2014your satisfaction, guaranteed.\"\n\nAnd that: \"Every transaction on Grailed is covered by PayPal Purchase Protection.\"\n\nWith NO mention of guest checkout on their main trust page or on the money-back-guarantee page in the FAQ. \n\nI would have had to go to the help section, then that separate FAQ section hidden below there, to find the phrase \"Guest Checkout purchases are not eligible for purchase protection,\" but even that implies it's Paypal's policy and not Grailed\u2019s.\n\nAnd in the checkout process, it also only says that guest purchases are not covered by Paypal, with no mention of Grailed. I\u2019m out $350, and if they don\u2019t return my money I\u2019m going to send screenshots of their false advertising and my communication with them to the Better Business Bureau, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll just delete my account or something.","title":"Grailed won\u2019t honor their money back guarantee","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=14&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-07-11","author":"Davin Zhang","text":"My account got frozen because Sam from grailed said I was selling fake Dior shoes on my account.
