Because it is the limit for seller to ship the item. Unfortunately I have this 1 seller, regarded as Trusted Seller and Quick Responder. It turned out the opposite. What made me wonder was why in this seller's listing, there was no \"Contact Support\" like other seller. So i have to contact support, but because no help I went to PayPal. And PayPal won my case so I get my refund.\nI hope Support could be more decisive, especially when there is so much evidence like screenshot chat etc, to this kind of seller.

Better for you to sell on any other platform: Mercari, Poshmark, even Ebay.

A few months later (still unaware it was fake) I tried to resell the item through their website and my ad immediately got deleted . Upon emailing them regarding the deleted ad they promptly responded and had indicated to me that the item is in-authentic and to send them all the information about it including photos of the item and a link to the sales ad , which I provided them . Fast forward almost a month after providing them with the necessary information needed to look into my case and also sending several follow up emails , I still have not received a response back from them . I really do enjoy shopping on Grailed but I believe not rectifying the issue and dealing with it in a timely manner is the antithesis of what Grailed is supposed to represent . Which is a site that provides authentic designer and street wear items that you can buy with confidence through a safe buyer\/ seller protected platform . I understand there can be a rare occurrence where in-authentic items make it through there verification process but Rectifying the issue promptly and being able to trust that they\u2019ll  stand by there protection policy is paramount .

I have emailed three separate emails for Grailed voicing my concern About all of my items being real (can provide receipts for everything), and no one has gotten back to me.

I am one of the sellers on the site who make an effort \u2014 whether it comes to the condition, presentation (nice high-resolution photos, good informative descriptions) of the items for sale or good customer service (I always try to communicate with the users in a courteous manner providing them with as much information about the item as I can so they can make the right choice). I do believe it's because of sellers like myself that buyers keep coming back to the site. \n\nRecently \u2014 just when Grailed raised their fees, to hire an army of \"moderators\" to police the site, it appears \u2014 they started permanently removing my items from the site in bulk, up to 10 \u2014 15 at a time, for being listed under what their \"moderators\" think \"an inaccurate designer\". How is a jacket made by Junya Watanabe Comme des Garcons in collaboration with Goldwin and listed under \"Junya Watanabe\", \"Comme des Garcons\" and \"Goldwin\" can be considered as listed under \"inaccurate designer\" is beyond my understanding. The high resolution photos of all the labels inside the jacket were in the listing. \n\nDeleted for the same reason, \"inaccurate designer\", a Comme des Garcons Homme sweater listed under \"Comme des Garcons\", \"Comme des Garcons Homme\" and \"Junya Watanabe\". Do their \"team of expert moderators\" even know Junya Watanabe designs for the Comme Homme line?\n\nThe items are removed without warning. You can't  appeal or relist the items unless you do it from scratch. Why not simply send an email to say what it is they find offensive and let us sellers fix the issue? Why not allow to appeal the removal or at least let us relist the original listing? What's their motivation? To punish us? To teach us a lesson?\n\nSo much of my time and work has gone into those listings and now everything has gone: the descriptions, the measurements, the photos I had carefully selected. Not even working links or the listings' numbers remain as everything has been deleted permanently.\n\nAs is customary with Grailed customer service, there's no one I can contact, no one I can direct this matter to. I wrote one of those emails to their customer support no one ever answers (ticket ID 710140). I wrote to this guy Lennox who works for them. Nice guy, we had exchanged a few messages some time ago, but when I sent him a message a couple of moths ago telling him of Grailed's removal of my listings, he never answered. Wrote to Jordan too but only got a generic reply providing me with yet another ticket ID \u2014 711422 this time.\n\nIt's been almost 48 hours since the listings were removed and I started contacting their customer service. No human being has got back to me yet.\n\nIf I want to reinstate the listings they remove I have to write the descriptions from scratch. I have to spend hours to reconstruct the descriptions from memory, unpack the item again (I care about the presentation of my items, I don\u2019t just stick them into an envelope and send them off: all my items are carefully wrapped and sealed in paper and stored away waiting to be shipped), measure them again and post them on the site, hoping the new listings don\u2019t get removed yet again because someone somewhere decides anonymously and unequivocally that the \u201cinformation I provided is inaccurate\". \n\nI feel hounded and harrassed for no reason and if nothing changes I am going to have to leave the site. I understand that my presence on the site might not be that important to Grailed in the grand scheme of things \u2014 if I go another dozen sellers might come along. But I believe there aren\u2019t too many of us sellers left on the site who are still putting our time into it trying to make it work \u2014 despite what feels like plain disrespect and continued efforts to undermine our work on their part. If this continues we'll all leave eventually.\n\nWe sellers are the ones creating content for them. We are the ones providing customer service to the buyers. We photograph our items for sale, we write descriptions, we answer questions. When we make a sale we pay them whatever they decide is fair. We pack the items, we ship them to the US from abroad losing whatever money on postage and packing because no one has cared to include an option to charge extra for international postage on the site. We bear the brunt of the situation if the items go missing or get lost or stolen. You'd think they'd appreciate us. But no, all they do or, at least, the only time I hear from them is when those lovely automatic emails arrive titled \"Your Listing Has Been Removed\" letting me know an anonymous \"expert moderator\" has just destroyed my work.","title":"Grailed keeps harassing long-time sellers","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=9&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-12-13","author":"Mahairan","text":"here I am humbly and apologize.

This summer I started selling some items from my personal apparel collection. Everything was smooth and all good. Till the point when my acc got frozen it only existed for 4 month and had over 90 transactions and 45+ good reviews with an overall 4.8+ rating with a trusted seller and fast responder badges. Never had any problems with the platform before and mostly had good experience until I got banned. The reason moderators gave me is \u201clisting of counterfit items\u201d. Please keep in mind my 45+ positive feedbacks, I would never list any counterfit item intentionally on the grailed feed and to my potential customers simply because I wouldn\u2019t want to risk my reputation. Since I\u2019m just selling items from my personal collection, I\u2019m mostly not even making any profit from that. I like quality designer clothing and always pay top dollar for my garments. That\u2019s why I would never expect myself getting a counterfit item after paying that top dollar for it. I have never sold any inauthentic items and I\u2019m strongly against of doing that. I currently have 2 sales pending which shipped and never got a chance to update buyers with tracking numbers and details. My account name is \u201carchivedrip\u201d and the case number is \u201c 714680 \u201d. Again, I never had any issues with grailed platform, I love buying and selling on there, just this only problem with my account freeze makes me upset since I would love to continue with my contribution to the grailed community.
