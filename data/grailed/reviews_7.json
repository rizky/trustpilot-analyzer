To make a long story short, I had bought and then re-sold a piece of clothing from Grailed, which, two years after I had sold the piece turned out to be fake. I found this out from a random email letting me know that my account was now frozen.\n\nInstead of taking the two seconds to realize that I had bought the fake piece of clothing, totally unbeknownst to me, from the Grailed website, they banned my account and sent me a hastily written email with absolutely zero context letting me know they had done a thorough investigation and this was the result. \n\nA week after I sent them a followup email explaining my situation, they send me an email letting me know that my account was unbanned. No apology, no empathy, nothing. \n\nI now have a 1 star review on my account which I had absolutely no control of (due to the fake piece of clothing), so I no longer can sell anything on their site. I used to work in customer support so I know how easy it is to humor a customer; They didn't even act like they cared. Grailed pretends to care about their customers, as I used to be a huge Grailed fan for this reason, but the reality is, they couldn't care less.","title":"Worst Company Experience I've had.","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-10","author":"n\/a","text":"I have been selling on grailed for quite sometime now, I've come to sell over 60 items and have luckily never had issues with my buyers. My greatest issue is the fact that I resell authentic luxury items - most of which have tags attached and are in brand-new condition. I make it a point to photograph every angle of the item, ( I am not green to the resale business and I am very well aware of how to provide detailed information on listings in order to protect myself and the buyer) so of course I include photographs of the tags, the logo, basically every angle close up and far away, it's all there. Obviously I spend my time doing all this which means I invest time into creating detailed listings but for some reason grail always takes down my listings ( about a day after I create it claims to be under review)  claiming that they need more information. This alone is very frustrating because I provide every possible piece of information for a clothing item ( not really sure how much detail you want out of the T-shirt or a sweater for example) . Many of the clothing items that I sell I have had for sometime and I am not one to keep receipts like many others, that is the only piece of information that I don't have but it seems like grailed feels that without it they have permission to take down your listing meanwhile nobody else puts these receipt images - I hope I'm making sense. My point is, instead of completely removing a listing that people spend time and effort creating what you should do is move it into the draft section at the very least if your company feels that it's missing some kind of information in addition to that perhaps your company should specify which information you feel is missing instead of leaving it a riddle for sellers. If you're selling clothing that has no brand then this platform is perfect for you, if you want to sell luxury goods - high end product then you will be wasting your time trying to create listings on here ( and remember time is money). I also reached out to their customer service regarding this because it honestly it is incredibly frustrating to have to deal with and to have to re-create each listing simply because someone on there end doesn't know what they're looking at. Customer service says they need \"more\" images ... well that's always been provided so I think somebody is lacking in their work department. Are you guys even looking at the listings and images provided? Do you guys realize how long it takes to create a listing on your website especially with your incredibly slow image upload system? ( and by the way there are only six slots for images and you can upload 2 at a time otherwise it won't upload any images at all) And don't you guys think that it would be better appropriate for your sellers - for the people making you money to at the very least make that listing a draft instead of totally deleting it?\n\nBy the way I see that there are a lot of short reviews on here and honestly they look fake to me. Just be aware there are plenty of other platforms that you can sell on that won't waste your time I have great customer service as opposed to this platform. \nIt also doesn't help that their customer service is oblivious to any question you ask them.","title":"This platform is a waste of time, here's why","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-11","author":"cuan sloan","text":"Grailed is gradually becoming the worst resell marketplace. Seeing the reviews this decline is unsurprising.\n\nHad sold a few items from my closet and received positive feedback so was on course to building a good reputation. But I had also purchased a few items which were safe and great thanks to graileds authentication process. However, I went to purchase a designer second-hand item for my brother's birthday, from a seller who had accepted my offer. I then logged in to his PayPal and had paid for the item via revolut and PayPal. The notification for money being taken from my card instantly came through from Revolult and then the screen froze on the grailed app. I tried redownloading the app and logging in but the section so where I had purchased had not worked at all. I had contacted Michael from customer support and he told me to try again. This time I did and then my app froze and had read error messages. i emailed him again and then he said my account was frozen due to my brother's \"suspicious associated paypal\". No explanation just a random statement \" suspicious\" What bullsheet excuse is this for banning an account in the middle of a transaction. I had done nothing wrong and now grailed has taken my money and I cannot even check my transaction which I had paid for!!!

So I list the holy grail of sneakers, my used Nike Dunk Low Diamond Supply co. I list them at an excellent price of $1200 for a fast sale as I had my eyes on some new releases. The listing had 15+ photographs and was VERIFIED by Grailed after 3 days. The listing went live and a buyer bought the shoes after about 3 hours. They sent over the money through PayPal and I told them I would ship the shoes the following day. \n\nSo far so good \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAbout 1 hour later I get bombarded with messages saying he \"wants his money back\" he \"made a mistake buying them\" \"it was an impulse buy\" \"I have to pay my rent\" and said he \"wasn't right in the head\" I was disappointed, I told him he had \"wasted my time\" but \"yes I will refund you after I finish work\" \n\nAbout 3 hours later I log into PayPal and see he was already issued a reverse charge and his money was sent back to him and I never hear from him again. No worries I say be gone and good riddens! I log into my Grailed account to relist the shoes BAMM account blocked and banned for selling fake shoes!! WTFFF!! \n\nTHIS KID HAD A FREAKER, TOOK HIS MONEY BACK AND GOT MY ACCOUNT BANNED LOL \n\nI write a long ass email to Grailed explaining the whole situation and if they look at our previous messages they will see I am in the right with the buyer and my shoes are real as they verified them themselves 3 days prior. (By the way, I bought the shoes in 2004 for 139.99 in a skateboard shop on Kelowna, so they are real) \n\nTheir response was \"you sold fake items on our site and are now banned forever\" I can't even view Grailed.com in my web browser, they literally deleted me from Grailed period! LOL\n\nI was pissed and wrote numerous emails over the next few days and they never got back to me. I didn't lose out on anything except my time and I'm not down money or the shoes but how they treated me as a new user and banned me with no proof of anything and no investigation is incredible. The buyer panicked and felt the only way he could get his money back was to report the item fake, in turn blocking me from Grailed forever and the buyer can continue on doing that as much as they want.\n\nDO NOT SELL ON GRAILED AS A FORST TIME USER. \ud83d\ude12","title":"PLEASE READ AS A FIRST TIME SELLER\u2026","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-13","author":"Leo","text":"It\u2019s funny how the company writes it\u2019s own reviews here you in order to keep a better profile while at same time has the worst customer service.
