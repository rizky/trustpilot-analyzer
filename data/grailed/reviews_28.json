I wonder how many times a buyer has tried to pay for my item and this has happened \n\nAlso, if a buyer makes an offer and the seller accepts and then the buyer never pays, nothing happens.

Ends up being a significant waste of time, why is this a policy? Really not sure what the impetus behind this policy is, or what they are aiming to achieve? Sellers trying to wheedle more out of buyers by artificially creating bidding wars?\n\nAccepted offers should be binding, unless there is a good reason to back out. \n\nQuick search for items shows tons of users with statements like \"Do not make offers unless you are prepared to pay within 24h of your offer being accepted\" etc etc","title":"Terrific platform-But needs changes","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=28&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-08-20","author":"Dan","text":"Single worst online purchasing experience of my life.
