Recently I have found the review process to be very inconsistent, tried to list my LV planes hoodie but was rejected for being \"inauthentic\". Knowing it is authentic I searched through recently sold listings and of course someone sold the same hoodie in just a smaller size and they let him list it. It highly confuses me why they let some people list their items and others out right do not allow them to list. The help or appeal process for listings is daunting to say the least, they advertise 2-3 days for a response but frequently it can be weeks I have heard and sometimes never a response.

Apparently their issue was with my necktag, which was extremely odd as when I originally posted I forgot to even put a clear image of the necktag, so its hard to imagine that they could even get a good look at it. I then sent a clear image and yet again they rejected it with a very general response saying \"flaws\". Knowing its legit I have now compiled evidence to prove my case using multiple LV listings from reputable sellers, I strongly feel and I am sure readers will feel the same, if they were to reject this then they are contradicting every post they accept. This link includes all the images I have sent,  the first two are mine and the rest are accepted listings from experienced sellers.
