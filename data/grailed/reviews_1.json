The first time I reported this, my issue was not resolved and the agent I worked with brushed me off. Then another agent assisted me and finally granted me the refund I needed in the first place. This is after countless emails sent back and forth over a matter of weeks. The agents also ask for screenshots for emails with THEIR agents. Completely ridiculous process.

I worked with Michael in their support area.  He was always very professional, responsive and saw my case through to the end.  \n\nAfter using PayPal for decades with zero claims, to say I was upset when they failed to honor their \u201cprotection\u201d the first time I filed one  is an understatement.  Their message to me indicated the item was \u201csimilar\u201d. They either have BOTs now reviewing claims or are uneducated on the luxury resell market. When you buy a high end piece of designer jewelry, \u201csimilar\u201d is not okay. \n\nWhat was listed was a Versace necklace with clear bright stones all in tact. What I received was missing stones and those present were mostly discolored to the point of being grey - black. While the item I received was authentic and was a Versace necklace, the condition was very poor, not as described, and not even close to being as pictured. \n\nMichael at Grailed helped me from the day I received the misrepresented item, through the entire process with PayPal and then saw it to the end by honoring their customer commitment of resolving all issues and protecting customers when it doesn\u2019t get resolved through PayPal. \n\nI have lost all faith on any \u201cprotection\u201d from PayPal, but I will absolutely continue to buy on Grailed because of their service, attentiveness to the issue and their commitment to seeing it through to resolution, even when PayPal fails to do so.","title":"Grailed stepped in when PayPal failed!","stars":5,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=1&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-21","author":"Adrian Bermudez","text":"Customer support was super helpful with assisting me with a seller who took too long to ship out an item I purchased and taking forever to send out a tracking number along with it.","title":"Customer support was super helpful with\u2026","stars":5,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=1&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-21","author":"Nurnabilah Jelani","text":"Grailed help me a lot.

Firstly all the positive reviews are of people who were scammed and then got their money back? That\u2019s not a good thing. Secondly, grailed allows for stolen items to be sold on the website. There\u2019s been an influx of stuff from ukraine so they also allow war victim goods to be illegally sold. There\u2019s no authenticity process. Take a look at stockx and compare. Grailed is a pawn shop; worse than Craigslist. No seller on grailed will ever have an original box or document. Most of it is stolen or counterfeit. For those of you living in a 1990s good will overcome bubble and wondering, \u201cwell if they are illegal then why is the site working?\u201d Wake up to you! Look around. Massive tech companies do wrong stuff and just get fined. At a certain size, a company generally will just exist and it\u2019s up to consumers to cancel the company. This is why cancelling exists now and so do sites like trust pilot. Grailed is a total scam. Their phone number is a bizarre voicemail. The sellers are all con artists who have these weird networks where they conjure up goods at a low price and mark it 20x to you - proven by any customs form you\u2019ll have when you get a product delivered. There are no longer the original scenarios of individuals who genuinely want to connect over fashion, blah blah. Think uber, Airbnb and all the abuses they did as they got larger. grailed is a dirty sick company. It doesn\u2019t need to exist. eBay and then goat and others are there.
