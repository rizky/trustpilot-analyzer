I do love the website and the ability it provides to buy some rare stuff but the first time I ran into a problem with the merchandise being non authentic I was beyond dissatisfied with the service. Basically it seems the Grailed guarantee is simply PayPal coverage and has very little to do with Grailed as you have to do everything yourself on PayPal. Anyone that has dealt with PayPal knows how flawed their claim process can be and how easy it is to cheat it.\n\nPrior my claim and during my claim communication with the Grailed team was rather poor and at times I had to constantly inquire about updates etc. And as many have said it felt like they could care less. Maybe it\u2019s just a case of them being overwhelmed and such is not their intention but since this review I can\u2019t help but to be honest here with the hope of this possibly improving their service down the road. \n\nAfter PayPal turned the claim in the sellers favour (go figure) I do have to give credit where credit is due and thank the Grailed team for stepping in and for actually providing a refund for my purchase. I think the claim process needs to be more direct and streamlined to create a better more efficient platform.","title":"If being honest I have to go with POOR","stars":2,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=21&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-01-10","author":"Alex Petersen","text":"My account has been froozen and have now been told 3 of my items are counterfit and the thing is 2 of them I know are not.
