Ive contacted grailed now 3 times about this and every time i have gotten the response that paypal will take care of it for me as long as i provided evidence. well guess what they closed the case in favour of the buyer even after i sent a video of me opening the package with the wrong item in it!! what more evidence could you need to see that this person is scamming?! at this point im under the impression that grailed does not care about the people who sell and only care about the 10% they make off the buyers. If they actually refunded me for the fraud i have encountered it would cost them money and im sure thats the last thing they would want to do which is pathetic. million dollar company screwing over innocent people trying to make a side hustle all becuase they would rather rely on paypal to review the scams than actually do something about it themselves!","title":"Buyer Scamming The Seller On Grailed","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=30&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-06-28","author":"Mara Georgescu","text":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND GRAILED. I bought an Off White Black belt (full price of course). And so when it arrived, I realized it is fake. The seller only posted the images that did not show the belt entirely, but it seemed new and i did not even think it was a fake. 160$ wasted on a fake belt on grailed, what could be better. After seeing that the seller is not replying even though I messaged him on Instagram and what not, I left several refund requests to Grailed and I did not receive a response. Also left messages on Twitter, i left a mail but no response. I would very much like a refund if it is possible.
