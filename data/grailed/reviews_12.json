There was no problem. I considered Grailed to be a safe marketplace. When this pandemic started, I had 2 cases that were closed with a refund to the buyers, due to delivery delays (total amount 170USD). After a while, I tracked the packages and saw they were delivered. I have contacted grailed to help me, and had no response.\nTwo days ago, grailed froze my account. I have 70 positive feedbacks and 1 negative, from a buyer who claimed I was a scam, due to delayed delivery, who received the package in the meantime. I also got in touch with grailed due to this VERY BAD REVIEW, which was not my fault, (I provided tracking, and now the package has been delivered) and grailed never responds me.\nNow, I have my account frozen, because they told me I sell counterfeits. I did sent an email asking details, which itens were fakes, and got no response. I would like to say that I don't sell counterfeits, I never did, I never will. I also would like to say, that even if I were doing something against grailed policies, it is not a proper way to treat people. I can't enter my account, I cannot respond to the people who bought from me. Also several cases were opened against me on PayPal, just because they saw I was banned. I did ship all my packages with tracking, which is a relief, because when they are delivered, I will receive my money back. But once again, grailed don't treat people well. I should be allowed at least to enter my account and talk to the people who bought recently. Not be able to sell, but to give people a word.\nI really hope I can get an answer from grailed and have a chance to defend myself. Or at least, a proof that I am selling the counterfeit pieces, like they told me.\nIt is very unfair all this situation and I am truly disappointed with Grailed. After reading all this reviews on Trustpilot, I see I am not alone....","title":"DiSAPPOINTMENT","stars":1,"location":"PT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=12&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-08-05","author":"Bill","text":"Hi,\n\nI have been banned from grailed because of I had the same info with another account which supposedly sold fakes.\nI stated before that it was my brother\u2019s account and I had no idea what he was selling fakes under my name.  \nIt was my mistake of course. \nHe was underaged until recently and I gave him my permission to use my info.\n\nI understand that its my mistake for giving him permission but isn\u2019t it such a strict punishment to ban my account after all these years without giving me any further option to prove that I have no mix with the other account?\n\nAlso you stated that his account bkdarchives was selling fakes even tho as I saw myself from the incident that he had no cases in his PayPal neither I had any on my account that have been active for 3 years now. \n\n\nMy account was legit with tons of feedback and always selling high end items with tags and all!\n\nFrom the other hand would I be so stupid to lose all my effort after all this time from this? \nBelieve me, unfortunately I didn\u2019t know nothing!\n\nI had like 15$k worth of clothing before this matter and already like 100 transactions.\n\nTry to understand my situation and I\u2019m kindly asking to unfroze my account Gucciway. \nAfter 3 years of being active with lots of sales and buys I expected to treat me with some tolerance and try to help me but instead no tolerance have been shown.\n\nPlease give me another chance because we both lose money in the end and I\u2019m not that type of a person to be selling fakes.\n\n\nUsername: Gucciway","title":"No tolerance shown after a misunderstanding for a long time user..","stars":1,"location":"GR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=12&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-08-07","author":"Balint","text":"Hi Grailed Team,\n\nToday for no reason I just got an email that my account has been frozen.

I\u2019m a seller on Grailed, have been since September 2019 and i\u2019ve had 36 transactions on the platform, 31 reviews all 5 stars so I like to think i\u2019m an honest seller. Fortunately this is my first issue i\u2019ve had (unlike many other sellers I see have had this chargeback scam pulled on them numerous times), what annoys me is the nature of this case. I sold a user an ERD t shirt back in September, he was a problem from the start, he had tried to make me engage in offsite activity - which I did not, and to make the situation worse his account has a red strikethrough, so he\u2019s obviously been banned for something, chargeback fraud maybe? Username is Kerwinfrust. So 11 MONTHS LATER, a whole 11 MONTHS we\u2019re talking almost a whole calendar year, he opens a chargeback case against me and my account on Paypal is now in negative balance. Paypal have updated me saying that they\u2019re going to have to discuss with the financial issuer now to see if they can recoup my money, but as we all know it will most likely result in me losing out and the buyer keeping a free t shirt. Transactions total was $270, and you know it shouldn\u2019t be much of a debate, this case realistically should be closed decided easily, if you\u2019re opening a case of \u201citem not as described\u201d you do that upon receiving the goods, not 11 months later. I have screenshots of his account being banned, the conversations, I still even kept the shipping receipt from last year September 2019 because I know you can never be too sure when there\u2019s people like this about. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to contact Grailed to make them aware of the situation and they seem to not be replying now, whereas when I asked them to add a new brand so I could sell something on their platform they\u2019d reply in a matter of hours, funny. It\u2019s amusing that they charge you 9% fees, which in fairness to them is cheaper than eBay, but they charge you a fee for using their platform and you\u2019d assume protection comes with that, otherwise if they\u2019re not going to cover you then everyone may as well go elsewhere or sell offsite no? To rub salt in the wounds further, their automated email reply states \u201cPlease remember all transactions are covered by PayPal and Grailed Protection. We'll get your item or money back guaranteed!\u201d I\u2019d like to see this in action now, practice what you preach. Furthermore when you see the reviews on here and there are more negative than positive reviews, well I guess that speaks for itself...","title":"Grailed Chargeback scam 11 MONTHS LATER","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=12&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-08-20","author":"Haitz ","text":"My account was frozen without explanation.
