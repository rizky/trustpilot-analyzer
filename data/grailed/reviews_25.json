[{"date":"2019-10-14","author":"Victor Atamanov","text":"Literally a joke. Posted my authetic LV bag and got banned a day after. Bought it on LV store in Paris as posted everywhere. Already got few offers and about 9 follows there. There also was 3 more bags with ABSOLUTELY THE SAME LOOK AT PHOTOS AS MINE ( really 1:1 ) from other sellers. But yes, they recognised it as fake, banned me and so on! After writing them back, they just answered with scripted phrase, that my item was unauthetic, lol. No proofs, just nothing. Script phrases on any email. \nSo nice service, will move somewhere else to sell AUTHETIC items.

Sellers need to be aware. \nThey basically do nothing to protect the sellers.  \n\nThe buyer allows to open a claim skip Grailed. I sold a supreme Champion Hoodie and Thrasher coach jacket hoodie. Total for $330. After I shipped them, the buyer opened an \"unauthorized payment\" claim and the money was charged back by paypal. I sent help request to grailed, they didn't reply me at all. After 14 days, they send me a message, my fund was released. What a joke!\n\nI also sold a moncler jacket, buyer opened an \"Item not as described\" case two weeks after delivery, without contacting Grailed. Normal case, the platform should be the middle man. The platform make a decision first, if buyer wins, he can open a case on paypal. Grailed skip the process and let buyers freely make claims. \nGrailed leaves all the work to the sellers and paypal. \nThis platform is costing me too much time and energy with very little earnings. \n \nRecently, there was a suspicious order from Canada, paypal said the buyer's account is not verified. I didn't ship the order, and my Account gets frozen. \n\nI'm fine with not selling on this site anymore. But I still have 2-3 orders need to follow up. I just lost all my access to my account. I never saw a platform frozen sellers account when there are existing orders. Clearly, They don't care about their buyers' experience as well.  \n\nMy paypal is also connected to my eBay sellers account. Can't let them mess up with my paypal. The increasing claims from grailed may cause holds on my eBay income.  \n\nI hope my account can be temporarily restored, let me finish my existing orders and disconnect my paypal from this site.","title":"This site needs to improve","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=25&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-10-16","author":"Xyhiem Milton","text":"So 14 days ago i sold some yeezys on grailed that same day i shipped the shoes off and everything.

To start off, I'd like to clarify that I love shopping on the site, it's something I do almost automatically if I have cash and free time.\n\nFirstly, I've had an issue with receiving a refund from a seller who chose not to ship my item out due to high shipping costs and we both came to the consensus that we would not proceed with the deal and he would refund me. However, the funds are apparently not in his account, thus he is unable to refund me and I have been given the same feedback to file a claim for the transaction using Paypal. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find the transaction within my account to file for a claim and have contacted Grailed team member, Wyatt again. I'd also like to mention that Wyatt from the Grailed team responded to me in about 3 hours so I am pleased with the ever improving customer service on the site.\n\nThe second issue I've had is that I think I have purchased an unauthentic item again on the site and would like the Grailed team to look into it once again, and refund me like last time if the item is fake. I have already submitted a review complaint under my account (@hypecats)\n\nUnderstandably, I have only submitted the request recently, but have written this review to try and reach out to the Grailed team faster.\n\nMany thanks, hope to hear from you soon. I also would like to suggest to the Grailed team to add a feature which allows for a verification check on items BEFORE allowing items to be listed on the market. Apart from that, special thanks to Nico who helped me in the past and Wyatt who is helping me right now, I hope to hear from Grailed regarding my two issues right now, thank you.","title":"Improvement but not good enough (2 ISSUES)","stars":1,"location":"SG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=25&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-11-01","author":"Whendy","text":"Your reason for permanently ban my account is totally blatant and exaggerated!
