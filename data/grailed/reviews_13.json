[{"date":"2020-07-13","author":"themostwanteddd","text":"Good afternoon. Today I received a freeze on my account, the nickname themostwatneddd. However, I don't understand why. Now I will give arguments. It all started when I put out a Dior saddle bag. A few days ago, all the photos were taken clearly and in accordance with the rules. Then they sent me two absolutely absurd letter, with a request for more photos. And then, a warning was issued. I have all the evidence that the thing is original. I contacted a Dior representative in my country this morning. We talked to them about this issue and they told me that they can not help and also do not understand the reason for these letters. My account already has transactions, the buyer is happy and never wrote about the fact that it is a fake. All things I sell exclusively my own, which were in use. Please understand this situation and give me an answer for what exactly I was blocked. I apologize for my English, I translated this message with the help of a translator. Thank you in advance. I will wait for a response to my email, I also sent an email to support.","title":"I don't understand why they blocked me","stars":3,"location":"RU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=13&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-07-16","author":"Gabriel","text":"I have been in Grailed platform since 2018 and have never had problems buying things from there, but after a few months I decided to sell some designer clothes that cost quite a lot of money, anyway I created the ads and I put the ads in grailed, as usual it takes up to 24 hours for the ads to be published publicly, but in my case they were never published, my ads were removed from nowhere, I do not know what is going on until I found out that Grailed sent a message to me who claims that my clothes are fake and that I break their rules, how the hell are my clothes fake if I have put pictures on labels and all I have to prove that my clothes are not fake? the logic does not exist in their world, I am very frustrated that I unfortunately can no longer keep changing my ads and do everything to prove that my clothes are not fake but genuine, I have tried to publish my clothes five times now and still they send messages that my clothes are fake, therefore I do not rate their customer service good, worst staff, believe me.","title":"My listings keep getting removed before they were even published for no reasons?","stars":1,"location":"SE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=13&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-07-17","author":"Alyssa A","text":"Bought a lock necklace that promised a key in the description.

None of things that can be remotely fraudulent were done, I never sold on Grailed, never listed anything, only 2 very simple transactions, paid through the site.
