[{"date":"2019-05-11","author":"Dylan","text":"So I was emailed stating my account had been frozen and banned due to fraudulent activity patterns on my account. I reached out via email and Lennox stated the same thing. I asked for any sort of proof of this \u201cfraudulent activity\u201d and didn\u2019t hear back for 4 days. When I finally send a follow up email and write my first review on TrustPilot, I recieved a response from Nico stating that my account has been frozen, not banned, for \u201cimpersonating another Grailed user\/ having the name SaruGeneral\u201d. I\u2019ve mentioned to every buyer that asks if I\u2019m the same SaruGeneral from Instagram, that I\u2019m not the same person. SaruGeneral reached out to Grailed about me having his name. I messaged saru general about this and he claims he doesn\u2019t use Grailed. I reached out via Instagram to Grailed to let them know and for a quick response. They told me all I would have to do is change my name and avatar and my account would be back to normal. So I reached out via email, and after three days, Lennox responds stating \u201cAs mentioned, you\u2019re account can not be reinstated.\u201d So why do I have three Grailed employees telling me different things? Two are saying it\u2019s due to the name and my account should be okay and sorry for the confusion. While Lennox is still claiming my account to be banned for Fraudulent activity.","title":"why isn\u2019t everyone on the same page??","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=31&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-05-14","author":"Monecka Freeman","text":"I bought a shirt on May 8 that was supposed to be fed ex and should have arrived.
