Grailed decided that these items were inauthentic according to them and without any warning PERM banned me. For example, if grailed would check my account that was deleted they would see that the Chrome Hearts hoodie that I tried to list (that they removed for being \"counterfeit\") was literally bought through their website and digitally authenticated by them! (I purchased it on my @_alealeale account and listed it on @alessandrov). I never even relisted any of the items that were marked as inauthentic (I only ever relisted when asked BY GRAILED to \"tag\" my items or add clearer pics of tags ect. once my items were deemed inauthentic I did NOT re post them again). Instead I tried to email grailed support BEFORE relisting to avoid my account being frozen but I never got and answer AND they froze my account anyways. At this point i'm not even interested in selling on grailed anymore because my authentic items keep getting taken down.
