Before I bought the bag I read the user protection info where grailed say they dont tolerate counterfeits and will assist you with paypal refunds or any troubles ... \nSo the bag I bought obviously was a fake, when I asked the seller for a refund he said he cant refund from his paypal because grailed took a big fee and he can refund the part the website took. So I contacted grailed and all they said was...sir, here is paypal phone number ... talk to them we cant help you with anything, bye... \n\nMy first experience turned into a nightmare.\n\nSo basically - when you buy on grailed you have a very high chance to buy a fake item and no one will assist you with  a refund, you will have to deal with the whole process yourself on paypal.\n\nIf you want to sell on grailed, just find a customer on the website and sell through paypal because you will not have to pay the fee, In case if a dispute you will have to deal with paypal  yourself anyway plus you will have full control of the refund. \n\nGood luck","title":"My first purchase on grailed was a \u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=36&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2017-10-10","author":"tntijw","text":"Got scammed, and the customer service was very unhelpful in solving.

When I asked why, he told me he sold them on more than one site simultaneously. However, a couple of weeks later he relisted the very same boots on Grailed for much more than he agreed to sell to me.

Grailed \"customer service\" attempted to distance themselves from the entire transaction immediately, and Paypal just closed the case with no resolution. I am out the full purchase price, have not received the item I purchased, and have gotten no responses to any requests for assistance that I did not have to raise a stink to obtain, and there is still no resolution in sight.

In any case, I sent a photo of the US postage on the package and they still banned me.

I noticed buyers storefront was mostly replicas so I reported him to Grailed. Grailed turned around and banned me and contacted my buyers to inform them I was selling replicas which was a flat out lie . As of today I have won the PayPal dispute with the scammer and forwarded that information to Grailed . I expect an apology at the very least for continuing the lie buyer had submitted to Grailed and for Grailed emailing my buyers who kindly supported me with the email you sent him urging him to file a claim with PayPal . That is illegal and morally corrupt  for you to do with no proof . I submitted to you tons of proof on this scammer . But you allowed him to stay as he continued to berate me via emails . But you all wouldn\u2019t even look at that . I will be filing with BBB and  FCC and take it all the way to the top to expose the corrupt business you are running here . Every item on the site new with tag is a fake as no one can ever supply you with a retail store tag . Red flag 1. And serial numbers but no one says a word about that claiming new with tags more like fakes with tags . All the trickery they use but no one will provide retail receipt tAg with price from retail store and provide you with tags that are useless no one ever shows inside of tags cause they are blank and should not be . Many use original receipts of designer but are still selling replicas . If you pay careful attention and know your designers well.  Ex Gucci belt should have a21 digit serial number usually starts with 112 or 223. Stitching of items other giveaway . But that they allow and runs rampart  thru Grailed . Perhaps we should start a class action lawsuit as I know many who have endured the same as I .  It\u2019s one thing to ban a person but when you attack my character with false allegations. Some one needs to hold you responsible .
