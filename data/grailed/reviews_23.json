[{"date":"2019-11-25","author":"Artyom","text":"My Grailed username: ArtyomKuplinov. A week ago a received three mails from Grailed about not enough photos for my items and that I have to add more photos. The first mail was received at 1:47. At 1:48 I received a mail, which said that my account is frozen for selling counterfeit items. This happened with my Louis Vuitton Clutches. I had three of them and each of them was authentic. Of course I immediately wrote a mail to support and sent them a lot of photos, to make them sure that my items are authentic, but they still haven\u2019t solved the problem. My feedback was strong (5\/5) and to be honest, I enjoyed selling on Grailed. I hope that you can help me with this issue. That was a misunderstanding.","title":"Frozen for selling authentic items.","stars":1,"location":"RU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-11-27","author":"saint ","text":"grailed was a grail for me i got banned out of nowhere for \"inauthetic items seems to be im not the only one, HOW when other sellers literally have the same items i was selling just with  better quality pics and i got my items authenticated prior to posting i dont sell fakes my feedback speaks for itself how do you send me a frozen account email first to reply to appeal then not even read my response and send me one right away that says banned with no rebuttal i still yet to get a decent response from you . \nUser:thekolectorr","title":"grailed was a grail for me i got banned\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-11-27","author":"Elijah Butler","text":"My account was frozen about 2 months ago.

The pair was listed under jakobdewald (username) and his history was 22 transactions with 11x5-star reviews. Before I made a purchase I recently made contact to your support team to verify the listing and the response I received was to send your team photos with my username, date, and the word \u201cGrailed\u201d as a tag. So basically with your response I had to purchase it first before I can have it \u201cauthenticated\u201d. (I should have insisted to verify the listing before purchasing since your website says you offer that service.) The photos sent by the seller checks out with an \u201cauthentic\u201d pair and I\u2019ve also reached out to the original retail store (basketzone.net) where the seller bought it to confirm the purchase. Everything checked out at this point.\n\nSo I went ahead and purchased the pair and once I received it quickly sent the photos (w\/tags) to grailed support team. Note that before I sent the photos I also did my own checks, compared it with my Jordan 1 Breds (2016) and also used \u201cLegitcheck App\u201d for reference and the pair I bought pretty much matches the \u201cauthentic\u201d pair. Now after a week, I received an email from Grailed\u2019s support team with a response that the seller sold me an \u201cinauthentic\u201d pair and they have frozen the seller\u2019s account. This was a surprise and complete shock to me. I was expecting a positive outcome. The reasons that the moderators used were:\n\n1.\tThe overall shape is off\n2.\tHeel shape looks off, especially the heel tab\n3.\tThe wings logo is unclear and dull\n\nI\u2019ve asked on facebook groups and checked online, compared the pair I bought to my pair of Jordan 1s, it checks out to be fine. I just don\u2019t agree with the moderator\u2019s findings. I\u2019ve been trying to reach out with your support team again to make an appeal but I have not received any response at all. I\u2019ve tried twitter, Instagram, reddit, trustpilot and not a single response from you. I just want to be fair to the seller who has his account frozen and basically make the necessary corrections. I\u2019ve made a paypal claim\/dispute as per your advice to document what has been happening and I\u2019ve been communicating with the seller trying to resolve the issue. He wants to clear his name and he is sure that there is a mistake somewhere. He should have tried and reached out to you by now. But the problem is whether it will be looked into for investigation. I really hope your team would do the necessary actions because in a way your credibility is at stake here. There must be some sort of misunderstanding or error that has been made. So please kindly look into this.\n\nThis is my second purchase in grailed and both of them has been only but problems. My first purchase never arrived. Now this time I requested to verify a listing but for you to do that I have to buy it and then come back to say it\u2019s \u201cinauthentic\u201d.\n\nUSERNAME:jhonaldcruz","title":"Issues with Grailed Moderators Authenticity Reviews","stars":2,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-11-29","author":"Ty Hibbitts","text":"My Email is: thibbs1023@gmail . com\nMy Username: twhy","title":"My Email is","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-11-29","author":"Chris Hernandez","text":"Terrible customer service they couldn't do any ting because pay pals site doesn't work properly and made me check out thru guest then the seller is banned for whatever reason and theirs no way for me to contact him back bc grailed blocked him.
