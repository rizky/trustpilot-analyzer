After that I just wanted to recoup some money and get a new shoe, because those gave me bad vibes. I attempted to repost the EXACT SAME SHOE I BOUGHT OFF GRAILED, and they took my post down claiming it is inauthentic! If these shoes are inauthentic, I DESERVE A FULL REFUND. No one on grailed has even attempted to get back to me besides automated messages that provide no help at all. This is how I am treated as a 5 Star seller on grailed for over a year now with 15 Five Star reviews. This is a significant amount of money to me and I am deeply disappointed in the response from grailed.

I sent in photos showing the size of the letterbox, which clearly shows any parcel delivery with that method is not possible.\n\nAccording to Grail, \u201c In order to unfreeze your account this dispute will need to be closed\u201d so I have to suffer a financial penalty, because the courier claims to have delivered the parcel, when clearly how they described the delivery could not have happened.\n\nThe account is frozen because my parcel was not delivered, I am being penalised for disputing this and to have the account unfrozen, I have to take a financial penalty!\n\nCompletely unfair decision, with little critical thought or logical explanation.\n\nGrailed username - garyharding21 \n\nYour argument is completely ridiculous, is got nothing to do with the size of the letterbox, but the honesty of the couriers statement about the delivery. If something goes wrong with a delivery you should investigate that matter, not hide behind your policies which are deeply floored.\n\nThe issue is; the delivery was made, but that statement is a lie, because the letterbox is to small for that delivery. So just saying the delivery was made is ridiculous, because I have not received the parcel. You should be investigating this matter, rather than penalising me.\n\nFreezing my account because I have made a claim seems rather counterintuitive, I have not received the parcel, I have lost financially on this matter and my account is frozen, what have I actually done wrong!\n\nI have been told the only way the account will be unfrozen, is to close the dispute. So I have to take a financial penalty because the item I paid for, I have not received.\n\nIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace, your conduct is ethically \nunlawful, I have paid for a item, I have not received, but I am being punished.\n\nThe conduct of the courier company is not even looked at, utter shambles.\n\nThe courier is myhermes, which has quite a poor reputation when it comes to delivery.\n\nFollow up\n\n\nYour conflating the two issues, this issue has nothing to do with the buyer, it\u2019s the couriers honesty regarding this delivery.\n\nSo I am not making a malicious claim, I am disputing the delivery of this parcel, that\u2019s the issue. \n\nYou are hiding behind you policies, you should be more willing to engage about this lost parcel.\n\nWhich clearly you have no interest in and my financial loss. The point should be, was the delivery successful, if I have not received the parcel, then clearly it was unsuccessful. \n\nJust stating the delivery was made is unfair, because your taking the word of the courier, rather than looking at the evidence.\n\nIf the letter box is to small, clearly the delivery could not have been made, that\u2019s what you should be looking at!\n\nThe courier had a choice, they could have posted a note, I have a parcel, giving instructions for collection at a later date. \n\nThe courier however, was to lazy and left the parcel on top the letter box, which is in a insecure area. Then claiming they posted the parcel through the letter box, this is want I am being penalised for!\n\nIt\u2019 laughable!\n\nAnyone reading this thread should be aware, the buyer on Grailed is treated poorly if anything goes wrong. Grailed and Paypal have received a percentage, the buyer received their money.\n\nI am the only party not to have received my item or money back, this is Grailed response to me, by opening a dispute, I am \u201c financially penalising the buyer\u201d just a bizarre use of words to describe the situation.\n\nThe advise they gave me was to contact the courier company, I did not buy the service, the seller is the only one could could do that.\n\nThey said contact the police, the police said I should contact the courier, so basically I have lost my money.\n\nBy opening the dispute with Paypal, I did not penalise the the seller, I was asking Paypal to investigate this matter.  But clearly you have know regard for my loss.\n\nAnyone reading this thread, I would advise any buyer to be aware, if any problems occur with that delivery, Grailed and Paypal will disregard you.\n\nIf the courier claims to have delivered your item,\nbasically any conversation you have with these platforms is useless, they will just keep saying it was delivered.\n\nSo if the courier leaves the package with a neighbour, it\u2019s been delivered. If the courier leaves the package outside your house is delivered. If it\u2019s left on top of a letterbox, it\u2019s been delivered!\n\nBy any logic, they clearly have not been delivered successfully, but the platforms hide behind this policy.\n\nA reputable courier will come back if your not in, however many courier companies, especially in London, will ring other buzzers especially in flats,\nuntil someone comes down.\n\nIf someone signs for that, according to Grailed and Paypal that\u2019s a delivery. So depending on the honestly of that person, if you receive that parcel.\n\nIf you have just spent \u00a3800 on a jacket and that situation occurred, Grailed and Paypal will just say it was delivered!\n\nI just thought you are the platform hosting the sale process, I just thought if any problem occurred you would help, clearly not. Very disappointing!\n\nI have closed the case with Paypal, when will my account be unfrozen!\n\nI am the only party to have lost financially, but the way I have been treated, you would have thought I had committed some heinous crime.\n\nThe crime being I have not received the item I paid for, just a utter disgrace!","title":"Grailed - poor customer service","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=24&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-11-14","author":"bbzbenet","text":"Horrible\nHonestly the worst selling experience online.
