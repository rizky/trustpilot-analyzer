They take a whopping 15% of the sale the greedy leeches. Along with this, they team up with PayPal. So together, they both take so much money from a sale. That means combined, they take $46USD\/$63AUD of a $300USD\/$410AUD sale... Absolutely disgusting if you ask me. Won't be selling many more items on the website unfortunately.

It is counterfeit, a fake.\n\nI contacted both the seller and Grailed and was met with an amateurish, dismissive response from both in regard to what amounts to illegal activity.\n\nGrailed makes much of how it will protect customers and touts these protections within its platform, heavily.  However, it is obvious from my incident that Grailed is interested in one thing: hanging onto the commission it made from the sale of counterfeit goods.\n\nThe response from Grailed actually made me more concerned.  Grailed acknowledges buyers describe items based on their interpretation of the items - facts such as actual label sizes seem unimportant. Sellers can also, as acknowledged by Grailed, add photos of other items similar to the item being sold without ever stating this i.e. misrepresenting what they are actually selling.\n\nGrailed actually suggested that an XL can sometimes fit like a small? Yes, it actually suggested that!?\n\nMy contact from Grailed has been woeful albeit fast - too fast to have carried out any proper investigation. It's like having a counterfeit issue dealt with by one of those inappropriately friendly younger people who allegedly represent charities on the street - forgetting that they are not your friend.\n\nMy only option now is to escalate this issue. I will.\n\nI would advise anyone to avoid Grailed entirely. However, if you do decide to use Grailed DO NOT pay via PayPal - use your credit card you have greater level of protection despite the nonsense noted on Grailed's website.\n\nGrailed. It takes your money and runs all the way to the bank without ever once looking back. A truly dreadful, duplicitous company.\n\nAVOID.  AVOID.
