In my opinion, it is much simpler and quicker to use this alternative app as a form of communication.

In 10 days the Seller did not respond so PayPal issued me a refund. I am a reputable buyer and seller with 70+ transactions and 5 star rating.

However it is a old piece so the engraving had gotten a bit old over time but that is completely normal due to age of the item So the fact that the Grailed Team has banned me for listing a legitimate item is beyond me and not to mention ive emailed grailed they say 2-3 business days response and its been over 4 days and no word. \nMy account name was ASAPGarments\nGrailed please reach out to me hondadirtlife @gmail.com ive reached out twice due to you guys saying you never received my message and still yet to reply","title":"FrozenAccount","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=18&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-04-21","author":"John C","text":"My username is jcamp186. \n\nI have been trying to purchase a jacket for days now.

I've been listing Off-White x Air Jordan 5 Sneakers, and Off-White x Nike Dunk Low Sneakers on Grailed. Every time I was trying to list my items I waited 48 hours and then received message that says that my shoes are inauthentic. I was trying to make more photos to proof the authencity but got declined every time. I'm 100% sure that my items are authentic, because I've bought them from Official Retailers (KM20, OFF-WHITE, NIKE SNKRS) and have an invoice letters for every pair.\nSo, I decided to write a letter to appeal center and handle this problem, because I knew, that my shoes are authentic and could proof it.\nThat's what I wrote to them:\n\"Hello guys. I have Off-White x Air Jordan 5 Sneakers, and Off-White x Nike Dunk Low Sneakers. Please, tell me, how can I proof the authencity of these to you, because I've tried a lot of times and you were declining them. I have invoice (letter from the shop) for every single pair and can make any photo that you will ask me to do. Also I do not understand how your team are legit checking every pair, just because I don't get any comments about my pair, they just decline it and tell me that it's fake. Why wouldn't you tell me why is it fake. I don't think that the official retailers are selling fake. So I am ready to deal with you and handle this one situation just for me to prove you that it's authentic shoes and for me to sell it on your marketplace. Thank you.\"\nDay after I got BANNED and received this message from appeal center:\n\"Your Grailed account has been frozen for listing counterfeit items. At Grailed, we value the trust and safety of our community and we reserve the right to freeze accounts that are inconsistent with our expectations. For the safety of the community, we're unable to reinstate your account.\"\nI already got 15 transactions to the moment and 2 feedbacks with 5 stars. I didn't even got chance to prove the authencity of my items.\nThey don\u2019t even consider it necessary to explain why my shoes are fake, while I did my best to prove the authencity of my shoes.\nThat is awful. I do not recommend to work with this marketplace, because they ban everyone for no reason.","title":"Grailed blocked my account","stars":1,"location":"RU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=18&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-04-24","author":"Rasmus Ty Hammarstrom","text":"Grailed has been great to me up until recently, where they haven\u2019t gotten back to me about my frozen account in over 3 weeks.
