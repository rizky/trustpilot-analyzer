[{"date":"2021-06-25","author":"Amina Khan","text":"Terrible customer service and questionable 'authenticators'. I was sold a pair of what I believe to be fake Adidas x Prada (came with no tags or box which is fine) but I took them to the Adidas store who stated it is hard to be conclusive without tags and boxes but looked at certain things like the smudged label and wonky Prade heel tab, excessive glue and uneven stitching - they are most likely fake. Their digital authenticators are clearly not good enough, and their 'customer service' assistant Emily needs to go on some training. I dropped Adidas a line to let them know that Grailed is allowing potential fakes to be sold, hopefully, that will motivate them to take it seriously. I'll be going straight to Paypal. Avoid Grailed and stick to StockX or even eBay. These are amateurs peddling questionable goods.","title":"Terrible customer service and\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=4&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-06-27","author":"Gruppe S","text":"Don't buy from these guys, owner Justin lacks integrity.

But, I\u2019m a Level 4 seller on StockX, blah, blah, blah. \nMy point: I\u2019ve been around. A few sales went through great on Grailed and I received perfect feedback across the board. Then, the scams started happening. New profiles with no purchase history outright paying for the item (even if it\u2019s above market), then being dead silent when attempting to speak with them, followed by (surprise!) an unauthorized charge claim on PayPal. Being wise to this, I put my profile on vacation mode, hoping that I could just take everything down when I had a moment. But, as soon as the clock struck midnight and my \u201creturn\u201d day began, BOOM another sale from a silent, rando, zero transaction buyer. Immediately, I contacted Grailed and asked what I should do-that this guy fit the profile of every other fraudulent purchase I\u2019ve received. No one bothered to reply. So, I sent the item out thinking that, after I tape recorded everything, bought insurance and signature confirmation, that I\u2019d be good. Then along came \u201cGavin\u201d from the \u201cGrailed Team\u201d more than 24 hours later saying to not send the item, if I did, to re-route it, and to go deal with PayPal. Yeah, too late. So, I tried rerouting it (hopefully, it\u2019s successful) and \u201cGavin\u201d\/Grailed have yet again gone dead silent regarding how they can help and did not answer my questions as to, inter alia, whether this guy can still leave me negative feedback since they (Grailed) expressly told me (too late) not to do business with the buyer, etc. One could argue that I could\u2019ve waited longer for a response. But, I pride myself on sending things out fast-StockX only gives you two business days and I\u2019m guessing that it rests on the premise that buyers should not have to spend their hard earned money for some seller to \u201cget around\u201d to something they\u2019ve paid their hard earned money for. Plus, over 24 business hours is plenty of time for Grailed to respond. Someone could also argue that I should\u2019ve refunded the guy on the spot. But, that leaves me open to negative feedback (from what I\u2019ve been told). With only a few sales, I can\u2019t afford a negative review. \n\nTL;DR: Grailed sucks; Grailed\u2019s mod team sucks, they offer no protection; they\u2019re lazy; they\u2019re rude; and scammer buyers are everywhere. I deleted every single item and they in no way, shape, or form deserve their cut of the sales. Other platforms are far from perfect. But, Grailed is a steaming pile of crap. Hopefully, StockX begins to accept used stuff or a legit middleman service that will help advocate for you (e.g. not a rando on Reddit) comes around; I\u2019d happily pay the premium for that\u2026\nStay safe out there, sellers!
