Hooray! Grailed is 50\/50. You either get somebody honest who will send you what you paid for, or you will get a scammer. Some scammers have made it far in grailed because people do not know how to tell whether their item is authentic or not. Long story short, i received a fake from Grailed and they are not helping me with this purchase at all. They rely on a flawed photo authenticator to prove whether or not your item is real. Maybe you can fool some people, but for those of us who really know the truth, you know having a fake is blasphemy. I would rather die than wear a fake and because of Grailed i might be forced to wear a fake Vlone shirt i recently purchased from this garbage site. I might have to wear this fake Vlone shirt to take out the trash or go workout in the gym because Grailed \"buyer protection\" does not protect anybody at all. Good luck if you get scammed. The people who rated this site poorly did so for a reason. And im here to vouch for that reason. Dont waste your time here because once **it hits the fan there is nobody there to help clean it up. Hopefully you arent looking at this review after you made a bad purchase because im here to tell you that only luck is going to help at this point.","title":"Im in the red now","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/grailed.com?page=2&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-11","author":"\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432","text":"My account was blocked for a strange reason.

For some reason my account has been frozen, it states some of the items listed is inauthentic. I got these items as a gift and it was supposedly purchased from a retail store. I would have not listed something if it was inauthentic, as you can see I am a loyal grailed user and have always followed the guidelines. I really need my account back as I have purchased things that I need tracking number for. Can you please reinstate my account, I did not know the items listed were inauthentic. Sorry. I got these items as a gift for my birthday and the person who bought it told me it was purchased from a retail store, I didn't know it was inauthentic, thats why I was confused when grailed sent email because I thought it was authentic. I love being on Grailed its my favourite clothing platform! I would never want to sell inauthentic items to buyers as that is incorrect behaviour. I myself  always scan through grailed and report inauthentic items so others dont get scammed. Please understand my situation, I would never want to list something that I knew was inauthentic. I truly appreciate you letting me know and creating awareness that the rhude tee item is inauthentic. I can guarntee this never happens again! If I am unaware of somethings authencity I will email you guys before listing so this way I will know forsure. I really need my account unfrozen as I have purchased hundreds of dollars worth of items and without my account, I will not know if they are shipped\/delivered as the tracking info is all on grailed.
