My account was recently frozen. I have emailed and appealed to grailed several times on reddit, their appeal email and even created a separate account to access one of their mods on site. All my messages were ignored. Their customer service is absolutely the worst. I've been with them since their beta stage with no fees and have helped them grow by providing superb services. My account has over 800 listings, fast reply, quick delivery, all throw away which I worked hard to create. I was definitely treated unfairly and am either being ignored or blocked. They claim I violated their rules for off site transaction, but it is the buyers who asked for my IG. All i did was provide it. No where did I agree to do an off site transaction. I would never throw my hard work to save a measly 6%. My account should be unfrozen.
