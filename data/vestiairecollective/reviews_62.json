I carried a big parcel to the drop-off point, which is the nearest 7-Eleven.\n\nI dropped the item off the drop-point they suggested and scanned the barcode on the prepaid label they provided, but it wouldn't recognise it. I asked for assistance from the 7-Eleven worker, and I did what he said, but the barcode is invalid. I scanned it again and again, more than ten times, still no good.\n\nIt suddenly rained when I got back, and luckily I always have a small umbrella with me, but it wasn't big enough for me, my dog, and the parcel. We both got wet because I don't want to wet the parcel with the item in it. I got home, wrote to Vestiare about what happened, and asked them to use a different postage service like Australia Post or DHL.\n\nThis is what they wrote to me \"I hope you're having a nice day.\n\nI am coming back to you on behalf of my colleague whom you have spoken to earlier today on chat. I am pleased to know that you have recently sold your Burberry cashmere scarf under reference n. 15556752.

I am so glad that I used Paypal to buy this item on Vestiare because Vestiare doesn't know why they can't issue the refund.

HOWEVER what\u2019s not good is that any items you sell under 1000 Euros will now be sent directly to the buyer. \n\nThe only reason I used VC despite their EXTREMELY HIGH commission fee is because when you used to sell an item it will go directly to their head office. Their team will authenticate the item THEN they will post to the seller. This protects sellers because it means the buyer can\u2019t lie and say they received a fake item, damaged item or incorrect item etc. \n\nWith Direct Buyer sellers still pay 35% commission but VC don\u2019t want to authenticate items before sending to buyers. They are lazy because they want to cut their costs and work. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I raised my concerns to VC and asked what would happen if the buyer lied. I was told the \u2018Expert Team\u2019 would investigate the matter?!? What does that even mean lol! You as a seller have already sent your item. But you\u2019re not going to get paid for weeks whilst the team investigates. Think of the stress and anxiety they are putting you through. \n\nI was also told the buyer can send the item back to VC for authentication?!! What good is authentication AFTER the buyer has already touched it? They can replace with a fake item, they can damage it on purpose to get their money back, they can say they received something else.\n\nVC has lost its customer service for sellers and I won\u2019t be taking the risks for hundreds of pounds. Shame.","title":"Deleted my account because of Direct Buyer shipping","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=62&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-26","author":"NT","text":"I have been an expert seller here for some years. It has become unbearable to sell on this platform- once I finally receive payments for my sold items (if I ever do!) I will delete my account. It\u2019s decent if you are a buyer. However as a seller it\u2019s awful. Platforms like the Real Real and Vinted are far superior because they take accountability when things go wrong, they issue buyer protection, and customer service is prompt and accessible- plus there is no fee to list!\nHere are the problems with VC:\n#1. The worst part is getting paid or getting a refund. 8\/10 times, the shipping carrier they provide is incompetent: the package is \u2018lost\u2019 in transit or cannot be delivered after contacting UPS numerous times! This often goes on for several months. During that time you have to wait. VC takes no responsibility for the loss of a shipped item. They do not update you or notify you if your package is delivered. VC customer service is nonexistent. You are forced to use a \u201cchat\u201d service to ask for help or claim a problem has arisen, and they often will claim that they \u201cdon\u2019t have the necessary clearance to give additional information\u201d. Then you must wait within 48 hrs for an email. This email \u2018update\u2019 will never arrive. \n#2. If you are lucky enough to have your package delivered to a buyer (and have remained patient during a 2+ week limbo period where the buyer forgets to pick it up + 72 hrs where the buyer can claim there\u2019s a \u2018problem\u2019), you may or may not receive your money! You are lucky if you receive an email! In that case you have to go back to a chat room and ask them what\u2019s going on! And most of the time they don\u2019t know!\n\n#3 As a Seller, you are penalized and your ranking\/visibility on the site is deducted if you don\u2019t ship within 1-2 days. Sometimes life happens- but if you send just one package later than 48hrs, you are penalized. But if the buyer takes 3 weeks to pick up said package, there are no repercussions.\n#4 Commission: Some items are not worth listing. If the item is 20\u20ac , you make less than 5\u20ac. They take huge cuts, and you can\u2019t communicate that with buyers. And you basically get no customer service for that commission rate. So you feel perpetually scammed.\n#5 Listing: They want all the photos on a white backdrop. Fine. But often it depends on the day or the person reviewing your submission that allows something to be uploaded. I have submitted the same item with the same photos only days apart after having it rejected the first time, and the second time it is accepted and put on the site. They can arbitrarily reject your submission for a million different reasons: they claim the price you set is too high, the photos are not good enough, or they give no explanation at all. In the meantime all the work you put into that submission is erased and lost, and you must start again. \n\nOverall it\u2019s a frustrating, unjust and honestly an incompetent platform. I have sold on Poshmark, Depop, Mercari, Vinted, etc and this platform is enormously more flawed than the rest. They are making bundles doing nothing and treating secondhand sellers like trash. I have even heard many people who have purchased designer items for thousands of dollars finding out (after taking the item into the designer headquarters for review) that they have been scammed and the items are not authentic - this is after the item was \u201creviewed\u201d and \u201cverified by our \u2018team\u2019\u201d as VC loves to claim with unwarranted authority. Would like to know who their \u2018Team\u2019 is comprised of. They seem to be as unreliable and ditzy as they come. \n\nMy advice would be to only buy here if you are looking for something very specific and are already familiar with a brand so that you know what is real. The RealReal should be your first stop before VC. Even so, don\u2019t hold expectations that you will receive your package! Otherwise beware!","title":"I am an \u2018Expert Seller\u2019-BEWARE: No Customer Service, No Accountability","stars":1,"location":"FR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=62&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-26","author":"Spring Lo","text":"Me and my friend are uploading like 20 items the recent 1 week but 100% of them got refused even:\n\n1. with purchase proof uploaded (I swear the items are all authentic)\n2. with very high res and clear photos\n3. many others are selling the same thing on VC\n\nWhen you ask their CS no matter live chat or email, \"what else I should provide\", they only say your product did not meet their criteria.
