Frankly contacting customerservice is crap. I ve contacted Alexander O, Adele, Madeleine G and Nati and nobody cared, let alone solved it, false promesses yes, we are going to do this, we are going to do that...FYI I kept all the chat conversations with above mentionned staff, just in case...\nLast week I sold 2 items, 3093975 and 3094002 to the same person, Darja. One shipping label, the one for item 3094002 wasn t valid, so I contacted customerservice via chat. A certain Nati told me that this wasn t a problem, and that could ship both sweaters in one box, since both sweaters were bought by one and the same person. The following day both sweaters were shipped, using the shippinglabel for item 3093975. Both sweaters arrived the following day. Asked the buyer if she did receive both sweaters, which she did ( please check comments under item 3094002) she even emailed to you to confirm that she also received the grey sweater. Guess what? I only got paid for item 3093975! I don t know what the problem is? Why making it so difficult? What more proof do you need? Frankly I m not a fan of direct shipping either...buyers can decide whatever they  want, they can damage your item and say that it arrived damaged, in order to get their money back. Fortunately the buyer of the sweaters was so honest to\nadmit that she received both sweaters...love to hear your feedback and to receive my money asap\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nA bit later I received an email from Alexander O. Apparently the internet connection was lost so he could not be of assistance during the chat. Good news, the money has been transferred to my wallet, special thanks to Alexander!

I've had to battle with them through PayPal numerous times after they denied refunds even after a second inspection. Why do I keep using them? I've gotten some good things despite the hassle. And of course I always win any battle because PayPal and my credit card back me up - and ultimately I am right. \n\nI used to get a \u00a315 voucher every time they made a mistake.

The hem was completely un-sewn on the bottom of the coat, and on one sleeve, making this 100% false advertising! It cost me \u00a360 to repair and they would only reimburse \u00a340. \n\nOn top of all of this, the coat was already at the Vestiaire Concierge Service so Vestiaire themselves KNEW the coat was not in Very Good Condition but they DECLINED my first offer, which was \u00a329 lower than what I ended up paying. Then they blatantly sent a coat that they knew was not in Very Good Condition, said I could repair it, didn't reimburse me the full cost of the repair. And the whole time, they could've taken my first offer given that it was not in the condition stated - and this would've helped cover the repair. \n\nI just want the money I had to pay out of pocket for their mistake! And I want to be treated nicely:\n\nWhen I asked if they could give me the full \u00a360 (after providing the receipt for the repair) they did the whole \"as per our previous email\" thing and said: \"As I have stated on the previous email, we are not able to offer higher than 40 GBP.\" ...As if I hadn't read their previous email.

Also they said instead of refunding me the difference they\u2019d give me a credit note for \u00a3119 to spend on my next order!!! Surely this isn\u2019t legal??! Absolute shambles of a company!!! I want my money back or my boots!!!

Evidently this happens often as the customer support guy was not surprised. I was told i would be reimbursed or I would receive the purse. Not one of those two things happened. Don\u2019t really waste your time, hope and money on this scam of a company. I am thinking of hiring a lawyer to get this sorted out. In 21 century, where big Percent of shopping is done online, they cannot scam people because they decide to do so. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SCAM.","title":"Dont go there","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=97&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-18","author":"CV","text":"Terrible practice of letting sellers changing their minds about selling the items you have already paid for to you, then relist it at double the price. \n\nSo I found a Burberry coat (ref:11729975) that I liked on the site and place my order (Order no 28772371), paid for it, waited for like 5 days and seller still didn\u2019t ship. Then Vestiare informed me that the seller said the item is no longer available, they would refund me. On the same day, the item was relisted under the same seller for double the price. Even if you think you list it at a slightly lower price, you made a commitment to sell it, once someone paid for it in good faiths, Vestiaire should make sure the item will be shipped unless under extraordinaire circumstances. They should not allow the same item to be listed again if the seller had lied and withheld it the first time. There should be a way to place review for each seller like other websites.\n\nOh and they gave me a 15 euro coupon while on that order I had used my 30 euro first order discount coupon which can not be used again.","title":"Terrible practice of letting seller withholding items after payment","stars":1,"location":"HU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=97&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
