I have sold a jacket from hm x erdem collection, which was in very good condition, with no tags for a low price already, as the website takes almost 20% commission. To think I only made 30\u00a3 on the sale. A few days later I got a notification that the buyer marked it as damadged and the sale was cancelled. The item was sent back to me. Mark that the buyer could have worn it and sent back to me in any condition they wanted as it is not checked by Vestiaire collective. If it was a massive difference, ofc I would understand. But I honestly sent an item that was in a very good conditions, having taken pictures of it without any alterations. The picture they sent me was laughable, and showed practically no damage just time passage. This was a horrible experience as a seller and I only hope my jacket will get back to me in the same condition it was sent (which I doubt).","title":"Absolute scam","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=94&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-10-05","author":"Mrs Gabeva","text":"Negative, negative, negative. I am giving ONE star just because there is NO option to give ZERO. And it is not that VC cares, they do not. But as i said earlier, if that can be helpful to other customers, will be nice.\nSo, before was that VC would heavily disappoint once per month. Whatever you do, you expect it to happen and it does. What is more ridiculous is that now they start disappointing in a shorter period of time - in this case 3 days later just a new ridiculous experience. This time - a brand new, never ever worn Chanel dress from 2016 was not accepted by them to post at all. No explanation. Just a short email - it was not selected. VC please do not call your team \u201cexperts\u201d or \u201cprofessionals \u201c because they clearly are not any of those. I am sure the managers are, but the team is just presenting themselves as a random bunch of people with mood swings and irrational behavior. Because anyone with any kind of basic knowledge of high fashion would not make decisions of the kind. It is simply outrageous. And I understand it is very difficult to find good employees (i myseld have 420, different industry and far more complicated than a trift online shop) but if you want to claim you are professional, be more careful with who you choose to work for you. Customer service is beyong ignorant and rude. I have had only horrible experience with them to the point that i stopped using them - as it is pure waste of time. On top of being unprofessional they are also rude. But what happened today is a completely new level of negative and shocking experience. How and who can possible decide that a brand new chanel dress from a expert seller cannot be selected?!?! And no explanations why - of course, because they have none. Just because somebody felt that way and because if they try to give explanation they know it will be defeated with a factual argument. They just feel good messing with people. But just remember- sellers are not here to make money, it is just kind of ok to make use of the pieces you do not but letting them go for a small amount and make somebody else happy. And VC makes money.  Mostly for coming up with a great idea but the poor performance is defeating the good idea. By pushing away sellers, they make no commission. Simple business logic. But again - the team of \u201cexperts\u201d do not care and the managers prefer to keep their eyes closed.","title":"More than Negative","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=94&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-10-06","author":"Shuo Zhang","text":"My sells of shoes and clothes went super well until I started to sell CHANEL jewelries...like the other sellers mentioned, they are rejected for authentity check but without specific explanation.

There is no recourse i.e. an ability to leave feedback to warn others so if this is how they get their kicks there is no deterrent to stop them doing it.\n\nI then got my first sale I posted the item straight away but it took them almost a week to acknowledge it. I then received a message telling me the bag that had never been used and removed from its packaging was covered in scratches; it was in perfect condition when I handed it over. A price drop was offered which I agreed to as I just wanted the long drawn out process over. It turns out after just receiving an email telling me the bag was on its way back to me via DHL the buyer refused the item. I contacted customer service and they tell me I should have received a message telling me this but when I asked when the message was sent they could not answer. I have just received my Tory Burch bag back and I am furious; it was not returned in the original packaging instead placed in some random plastic bag. Also the plastic protection covering the clasp had been removed and randomly stuck to the leather at the front of the bag. The part I am most annoyed about is the huge scratch down the back of the bag which was not there when I handed it over and I have photographic evidence to prove this. I am now raising a formal complaint and have asked for a full explanation as I will be taking this matter further.  I will never use this company again and based on my experience advise all others to avoid it.

True, because the seller and I communicated - VC chat said they couldn't do anything about the higher price in the checkout and didn't want to admit there was an issue. Hey? Accepted bid of \u00a366 turns into a 3% higher amount at checkout - sharp practice. Without my consent - illegal? Small amounts add up....\n\nWe waited until the offer expired then I put in another bid. This second time the bid amount wasn't changed. \n\nVestiaire's denying there was a serious 'technical issue' is typical and shows they won't investigate and correct it. Their technical people are sloppy, not 'expert' and if the 'bug' doesn't happen a lot they'll just hope people won't notice: if one bought a number of things one might not.
