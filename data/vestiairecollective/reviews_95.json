I would strongly recommend you to use other platforms in the market and avoid this !\nEdit: this response from vestiaire collective to my review here and which directs me for the FAQ is another joke of how irresponsible they can be. This person just wants me to repeat the same process again and again. Lol. In the meantime, After the initial chat conversation I have received an email by a supposed \"higher\" department that said the sale will be cancelled. They didn't care about contacting the buyer and try to arrange a different way to send the item. Vestiaire was taking 100eur as a fee.

Other items I\u2019ve received have been very good, let\u2019s hope my luck holds\nThat being said, I\u2019ve mostly bought items that haven\u2019t been too expensive, like kids-wear and home. I\u2019m not comfortable paying loads for designer goods that are second hand, no returns and quality not guaranteed. I\u2019ve seen a few items that are more pricey, but I\u2019ll need to think very carefully before buying. \nAs seller, I\u2019ve sold quite a few items and am now an expert seller. Like with buying, I\u2019m not comfortable selling highly priced or special designer items here. The main plus is that they sort out posting for you, very easy and less hassle than say Ebay. But app and uploading is very buggy, and IT structure is atrocious. There is no rhyme or reason in brands selected (for instance why accept Zara Kids if you don\u2019t accept Baby Gap?). The result is that it\u2019s pretty dull with brands and clothing, nothing new unusual or exciting. Wish there was a way to input brands I\u2019m looking for. My experience of customer service has mostly been good. I do feel they discriminate against British sellers, as I see European sellers getting away with selling certain high street brands, but when I try to sell them, or sell an item from a UK brand on the same level, it\u2019s refused. And also they\u2019re less stringent with European sellers when it comes to pictures. The commission is outrageous, especially on something like childrens clothes which don\u2019t go for much anyway. That\u2019s also put me off buying, as I know the sellers get so little, it doesn\u2019t seem fair. \nSo overall, good and bad. Worth trying, but be careful and don\u2019t hope for much.\nP.S. tip if you\u2019re a new seller: put all your unsigned\/non-designer stuff to sell on at the beginning, when they\u2019re more likely to be generous. After that, you can kiss goodbye to trying to sell anything not in their brand list.","title":"Could be worse, but buyer beware","stars":3,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=95&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-10-01","author":"Ana ","text":"On the 20th September I bought a pair of sunglasses from Vestiaire, order N\u00b029993516 .

Just when you start thinking that they have exhausted all options of being unprofessional and outrageous, there is a new surprise from them. This time i had to read their email few times just to be sure that i got it right. I have sold more than 235 items. All of them either not worn or worn very little. When an item is worn a little, although no signs, i always say that has been worn, just because this is the right thing to do. And i also have a rule - before posting an item i always first dry-clean it, no matter worm or unworn. I also post my items at very low prices although they are all high-fashion, but this one is on me, i mean has nothing to do with VC. So what happens. Two days ago i sold a Chanel sweater. Shipped it right away as always. Now i am receiving an email that the item has ... slight odour. Shock. Of course it has, it has been dry cleaned 10 days ago before posting and of course as i use a really a good dry cleaning, they use nice detergent. All 236 items had the same odour. But this time they decide that this is flaw and it has not been mentioned in the description!!! Really?!?! As a result they do not reject the sale but they propose a price reduction of 48 eur (and believe me it is already sold at a very low price. So, yes, of course i will accept it just because i have absolutely no time, desire or interest in dealing with them further. And i guess they keep doing that because they know people just do not feel like dealing with them. So they keep getting away with everything. But how ridiculous is that that they ask for a price reduction just because the item has been dry cleaned? Is it better just to send something that has hung in the closet for an year although it has not been worn?!?! I believe that actually taking it to the dry cleaning before posting it is a nice gesture to the future buyer. But obviously that is not way VC concept is who only pretend to care about their customers - both sellers and buyers, but their actions just prove the opposite. And now, i also feel bad for the buyer because i am not sure what they might think about the so called \u201codour\u201d as i have no chance to explain to them what is the actual case here. I am already so used to Vc absolute lack of professionalism that i do not even care so much but i have decided that every time something negative happens i will just keep sharing the experience.
