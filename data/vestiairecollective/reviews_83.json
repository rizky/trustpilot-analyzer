[{"date":"2020-12-18","author":"Ana","text":"I bought two items from VC page. When I received a quality report check for my first purchase, a Louis Vuitton bag, it didnt stated a flaw which was very obvious when I received the bag but I let it go because I liked the bag and it wasnt such a big flaw. My second buy was Valentino rockstud tote and everything seemed great, I took off VC card from the bag and wore the bag for two days (held it in my hand for probably less than an hour during those two days). It was very very lightly packed although it is a big bag. On the second day I have noticed the studs came off and also a buckle. I was shocked and wrote to VC immediately. The bag was obviously defected but camouflaged to look good. I wanted to return the bag because it seemed crazy to give 1000 euros for a defected item that started to fall aparat after one hour of wearing. VC told me that I couldn't get a second check nor a refund if VC tag was detached. And that is it.. \nno liability, no customer rights no nothing. I really dont have the time or energy to pursue this mater, I will find some expert to fix my bag, but I just want you to know that you cannot trust VC if you encounter any problem so please be extra cautious. Or better yet, find some more trustworthy service.\n\nUPDATE - regarding VC response, I have sent you an email yesterday (18.12.2020.) morning and no one answered. The link you gave me leads me nowhere so please just answer my mail.\n\nUPDATE - I was granted a second quality control check from VC after which they told me that the Quality Control team has verified authenticity of the bag and stated that the bag meets all of the quality standards of the brand. They did not comment on my main concernes - why there is no serial number on the bag and why it had started to fall apart after an hour of wearing it. I then took the bag to an expert and he told me that the bolts that came off were so deformed which indicates that the previous owner was unprofessionally trying to fix the bag. So my bag expert is unable to fix the bag and now I have a bag which I paid 1000 euros that cannot be worn. I understand that VC didnt see that flaw during first check because it was well hidden. But on the second check they could see deformed bolts and could have come to the same conclusion as my bag expert - but THEY ARE NOT EXPERTS. They are just frauds that can not admit their mistake and return the money for an item that does not match the description. What can I do now..engage legal expert?

Plus i thought i have went over every single bad experience that one can have with them. But guess what? They really never fail to find a new way to disappoint. Obscene. I sold a Chanel skirt (12088659) more than two weeks ago. Supposedly when \u201cchecking\u201d they found some little \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d. Whatever. I have long given up trying to prove them wrong when they usually are. They offered a price reductions, i accepted just to take this off my plate. More than two weeks later nothing happens. No info, no payment. I know this cannot be true as the buyer is not going to have his money blocked for such a long time so might have accepted or rejected the proposal, and simply VC did not update the system. So, very reluctantly i am left with no choice but to contact customer \u201cservice\u201d. Surprisingly i am lucky to chat with Mark P, very polite and responsive gentleman, who assured me that the buyer has accepted the proposal and there was a glitch in the system which prevented me from getting paid and he will personally fix it immediately. So far sounds good. As nothing changed today i contaced them again. Surprisingly, Ida from customer service told me that Mark P lied and supposedly the buyer has not given a response yet. Which sounds very unlikely. What kind of system is that? Do they know what is going on or they are just saying whatever they decide to say depending on who you have the bad chance to get in contact with? To me this is a fraud. Many people have shared similar experience, i was somehow lucky till now not to have one of the kind. But as we know VC is always quick to give you any kind of bad experience one can possibly do. The worst part is - i am not shocked, i am not even angry. With them you just expect it as with the experience one has one knows that there is ZERO security, ZERO transparency, ZERO customer service, ZERO willingness to avoid problems and ZERO ability and desire to solve problems. And all of this is to be expected when you deal with them. And i have said before - they are using their position  of being the only ones with good concept in europe and exhausting the benefit of the monopoly till they can, instead of trying to do better.

And the way the sale was handled left a very bad taste in my mouth. I'd like to give you a suggestion on the way your platform feature is handled before I decide if I want to take all my future sales to Real Real instead. \n\nEverything was fine up until VC has received the bag. After the authentication process I received an email from VC saying that you have detected a tiny little mark on the bag which was not mentioned in the description. I thought to myself okay that's fine and let me have a look at it. I saw the picture and the mark was so insignificant and it's located inside the bag that it's not even noticeable. But I was willing to offer the seller a 200 euro discount. And then I scrolled down the page to see where I could send such offer, that\u2019s when I saw VC has suggested me to deducted the sale by 1050 euro!!! I thought to myself you must have lost your mind to have the audacity to ask me to accept such a significant discount so of course I rejected it. Only after the rejection, I was able to find out that VC has offered the exact same amount of discount to the buyer without my consent.\n\nAnd here is how it went terribly wrong for me - VC is a marketplace and your duty is to facilitate each sale, authenticate each item, make sure sellers get paid in time and buyers get their products in time in the condition that they expect. Negotiation on behalf of either party is NOT your job. Maybe a mediator at most, but a facilitator is most accurate. I am a real estate broker and my job every single day is to negotiate for my clients. The first thing you do in a sale like this is you ask the seller if he is willing to lower the price (after a discrepancy has appeared). And if the seller says yes then it is up to the seller how much he is willing to offer as a discount to his buyer. By having you suggest a price to both the seller and the buyer without the seller\u2019s consent, you have taken away the seller\u2019s right to a fair negotiation. Because you have framed the negotiation (intentionally or unintentionally) in a way that the buyer now has a much higher expectation on how much discount she can expect based on your suggestion. In negotiation it is called anchoring and by doing this the seller has been involuntarily forced into a biased negotiation. In addition, by not giving the seller an option to offer a discount on his own will on your platform, VC has diminished the power of what could have been a nice act of goodwill to absolutely nothing. The buyer could have received a 200 euro discount from me and instead now I just look like a cold-hearted seller who doesn\u2019t care about his buyer. In fact when I tried to communicate to my buyer in the private chat that I was willing to offer a 200 euro discount on the sale by making a bank transfer to her (because like I said, VC doesn\u2019t have the option for the seller to offer a discount through their platform), VC banned me from the chat feature for 24 hours, because they thought I was going to take this sale somewhere else outside the platform.  All of these nonsense made me feel like I was just a dollar sign to your company. You should not be worried about me taking this sale to somewhere else, you should be worried about me taking all my future sales to somewhere else.\n\nHow can you do better next time if a similar situation happens again \n1. Ask the seller if he is willing to offer a discount to the buyer\n2. If so let the seller initiate an amount to offer which the buyer then has the option to select either accept or reject (exactly like how a negotiation works during your pre-purchase negotiation stage on you platform)\n3. If accepted by both parties, the sale goes through at the new price\n4. If not accepted, then the product gets resisted or sent back to the seller.\n\nNEVER EVER suggest a discount to the buyer on the seller\u2019s behalf - you are not the hero here so please don\u2019t try to save the day by acting like one. Let a fair negotiation be the job between the seller and the buyer. Your responsibility as a facilitator is to provide a platform that is safe, easy to use and bug free. Therefore please spend more time on making these things your priorities.","title":"Dont Act Like a Hero","stars":1,"location":"IT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=83&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
