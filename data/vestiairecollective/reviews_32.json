I can't stress this enough. \nI've sold multiple items and bought a lot, and everything was (almost) ok until now.\nI bought an item almost 3 weeks ago. A week ago I receive a notification that the item arrived at their warehouse and was going through the process of being authenticated. After a week of going back and forth with customer service in order to find out when will the item be sent to me, they claim they actually never received the package from the seller and that the item is lost. I asked for a refund and they refused. They asked for my ID in order to open an investigation, which I told them I will not provide, because that's between them and the seller, I have no part in that. They never explained why they need my ID, since the shipping company that supposedly lost the package only had the seller and their information. Why is MY personal private info needed??? I now see this is a common abuse they do. \nI asked multiple times for a refund, they refused each time. So basically they stole my money. \nI opened a claim with Paypal and now waiting. \nA similar thing happened a couple of years ago when a seller never sent the item and they refused to issue a refund and told me I have to wait 30+ days in order to get my money back. I had Paypal step it and got my money back. \nOnly shop with them knowing these things happen and take all precautions.

Secondly, this is the second time I have had to leave a review because it seems to be the only way to get somewhere with this company! You just had a billion dollars worth of funding....spend it on customer service!!!\nI can't fathom luxury goods and the fees you charge and having customer service that can't answer simple questions, not a lux experience at all.  \nI got an email stating I need to cancel my premium or it will be renewed for a fee. I literally asked customer service this months ago (August) and was told my product is a one off and it won't renew. \nI go into my account, try to figure out how to cancel and can't, its not listed on anything (I tried app and desktop) so I email customer service. Bear in mind this is after speaking to someone on chat who said \"your product won't renew don't worry\". \nI opted to contact and get double confirmation because I have dealt with VC customer service a few times and they are usually polite but completely uninformed. I got an email back today \"unfortunately you can't cancel its less than 10 days-it cancels in 3 weeks. He couldn't be bothered to double my information before sending an email. Beyond frustrating dealing with this company. Cancel my premium!! I would do it myself if I could. \nAll this being said, the Premium product itself isn't bad but dealing with the company when I need something is maddening, final straw for me.\n\nUPDATE: 16 emails later I was able to find it in the desktop site and unsubscribe. This is my second really lousy VC experience. I was sent a fake bag months back and haven't purchased a thing since. I was not expecting to be enrolled in an auto renewing service without notice and was hoping to never have to deal with their snobby, rude customer service ever again.

Vestiaire has offices in LONDON. Nothing was flagged on your website when the quality control option was selected to say you would not in fact send the coat to London and that 'crossing borders' to France would be required. If I had been made aware of that I wouldn't have gone ahead with the purchase.......\n\nUPDATE:\n-------------------------------------------\nI did end up getting my money refunded to me (given how vastly different the item received was to what was described I had my lawyer at the ready had the decision gone the other way). However, I paid for Vestiaire to undertake quality checking before the item was sent to me. So it should never have passed that check and been sent out to me in the first place. Therefore, I am extremely wary about purchasing anything from this website in the future given that their quality checking process clearly does not work. An incredibly disappointing and stressful experience from start to finish which is not how you want to feel when spending hundreds of pounds on a designer item.","title":"Worst experience with Vestiaire - item NOT as described at all","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=32&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-30","author":"Customer","text":"Don\u2019t trust them.
