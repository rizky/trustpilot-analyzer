When the item arrived the metal work was not of the quality I\u2019d expect but I trusted it was genuine due to the authentication process. I spoke to a couple of independent luxury resellers about selling the belt on, as it doesn\u2019t fit me, however they were unable to verify it\u2019s genuine and actually implied it was a fake due to the lack of a stamp on it. Stamps were introduced in the 1950s for Chanel items. I spoke to vestiaire via chat and after several attempts where they told me they had added one to my account, but they hadn\u2019t, managed to get a shipping label to send it back. I was told to expect a refund within 48hours. \n\nI chased after 2 business days and four business days, and was basically told to be patient and I\u2019d get an email about it. It took just over a week to get an email telling me they\u2019d looked at it again and it\u2019s genuine so I will not get a refund and they will send the item back to me \u2018as soon as possible.\u2019 Absolutely no justification as to how it is genuine or has passed checks when other Authenticator from outside their organisation do not believe it is so. \n\nSo now my two options are to receive back an item I believe is a fake, and attempt to sell it through their website since other preloved luxury sellers won\u2019t accept it, but live with the knowledge I\u2019m passing the problem onto someone else. This was suggested by vestiares, obviously, since it makes them more money again.  Or, keep the item, never use it and know I\u2019ve got hundreds of pounds down the drain due to Vestiare\u2019s incompetence.","title":"Fake item","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=56&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-06-04","author":"Liv","text":"Stay away from them\nStay away from them. The concept they have may be brilliant but everything apart from that is just flawed! The app is full of bugs, their customer service is only reachable via chat within the app and handled by some off-shore team using poor translation services, they used to have a support email that is now deactivated and they hold true to NONE of their promises. Refunded if seller hasn't shipped within 7 days? A joke. Your money is gone and nothing happens. NOTHING. There are no automations, no updates, no anything. Customer care is absolutely zero as you can see from Trustpilot. They aren't even bothered to reply or care, possibly due to lacking a structured CX team...

The handbag was described as 'Never Worn', therefore according to Vestiere's own policy, it should have no defects. Upon receiving it,  the CC logo on the front of the bag was clearly tarnished. I showed a customer rep the photos of this via the online chat. They apologised profusely - told me that it didn't meet the item description, and sent me a postage label to send it back for a refund. \nNow, Vestiere are sending the bag back to me again as they think it actually DOES meet the 'Never Worn' policy. Vestiere obviously don't read their own policies, they also don't check their items properly for defects. This has happened to me in the past but I've always got my money back as I've paid via PayPal. This time I paid via credit card. I have now made a chargeback claim to my credit card company to get the thousands back that I paid for good bag. Awful, untrustworthy company. Never again!\n\nUpdate 15th June: on 11th June, I received an email from Laura at Vestiere. She said that the mark was a 'friction mark' and not a stain. Apparently that means that it meets the 'Never worn' description. Then she suggested that I get it professionally cleaned - I had to admit, the email did make me laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. I received the bag back today as Vestiere have sent it straight back to me after I received it. Lo and behold, the 'friction mark' (stain) has been cleaned off by Vestiere's authentication team.
