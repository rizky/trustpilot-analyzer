Chat is a waste of time. Finally they concluded that the item was indeed lost, however to pay me, they now want an ID, a passport or a driving license.\nHere is the problem:\nThe UK has no ID cards, I have epilepsy, so I am legally not allowed to drive and since I can't travel much anyway (long journeys can trigger epilepsy) I have no passport.\nI thought it was not a problem, I am married, so I use my husbands driving license and utility bill, now the system doesn't recognize it, despite the fact that we have the same surname, I even changed my account information to his information (looks a bit weird if a man is selling women's clothes, but hey) apparently it is still pending.\nI tried to go to chat and as usual it was a really bad experience, the customer service agent (Jose Jiggo) spammed me with auto replies, obviously didn't read a single thing and told me to empty my chache, which has nothing to do with the fact that Vestiaire claims they can't verify my ID. I tried to ask if they would accept a letter from the National Health Service, a birth certificate, a marriage certificate, I was told to restart my computer.\nTo sum it up, your carrier has lost the item, you now create hurdles to avoid to pay me. I really can't force the UK government to issue ID cards, ordering a passport is quite expensive and since I can't travel no use to me, and since I am not allowed to drive due to health reasons, how could I get a driving license? \nI am not being rude, but you are hardly the most organised company, so you do demand very sensitive documents which I supplied (in the form of my husband's documents due to before mentioned reasons) and I have no idea what happens with them, how securely they are kept....","title":"The UK has no ID cards","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=34&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-16","author":"Sophie","text":"I won t stop posting negative reviews until I receive a decent answer about the whereabouts of my order of item18888058.

I bought a \u2018La Perla\u2019 silk dressing gown (order no: 46698796 ) that after purchase I noticed was not showing the belt, I queried as to why & was told it has been lost,  so I contacted Vestiaire to cancel (as the seller has refused to accept a cancellation) all of this was before it had been dispatched I hasten to add. Vestiaire said that the seller didn\u2019t state it had a belt so therefore it was not missing a belt ! ( despite the gown having loops for one) Then to add insult to injury when the item arrived it was worn looking with a small hole and bobbled worn areas, and a thread pull.  The seller had said she\u2019d only worn it a few times, which was a blatant lie judging by the condition and anyone inspecting could see that. \nI immediately took pictures ( which I am happy to share on here ) and sent them to Vestiare requesting a full refund of all costs incurred by me, the refund was unacceptably denied but they agreed to have it reevaluated and a full refund would be issued upon the findings. I was assured by customer services that they were aware that the item had been sent after I\u2019d cancelled it and that there would be no issue in returning for a full refund, they said they had also made note of the sellers behaviour in this. It was then to my real surprise that they then re-evaluated it ( as in inspected it ) & said that item was acceptable to sell !! Shockingly poor. The response also  stated  that they were now trying to resell it on my behalf ( which is pity for the next poor buyer but out of my hands).  This was all via an email that you could not respond back to: no-reply@emails, which is not at all helpful. \nI would  have expected a full refund in a case like this, together with an absolute apology.
