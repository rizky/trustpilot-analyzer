What I\u2019d like to say to the CEO is that little by little, bad reviews pile up, word eventually gets round, media and publications will stop working with you and mentioning the brand and then usually at this point a company will begin to go into administration. \n\nSo enjoy being dishonest and doing wrong by people because it might not make any difference now but it will. \n\nI have listed with them before but today I\u2019m leaving a review as a potential buyer. \n\nI cannot stress this enough - stay away from this site. I don\u2019t believe they authenticate anything and even if they are, I don\u2019t believe they have the skills to do so properly. \n\nThey charge the buyer a control and authentication charge, (fine and understandable if you can actually trust they are doing that). Apparently this charge is optional (it\u2019s not). \n\nUnless you have a genuine sales receipt, don\u2019t go near it is my advice. \n\nSo I get to checkout on an item I\u2019m not entirely sure about being genuine anyway, no assurances whatsoever apart from some random in a warehouse looking at it I\u2019m guessing. I then see they\u2019ve whacked on a \u00a339 postal charge! \n\nConveniently, they only have 4 listed countries that allow direct shipping. For no logical rhyme or reason. I post items internationally all the time for work, it doesn\u2019t cost \u00a339 to ship a purse to the UK with any shipping company. \nRoyal Mail charge \u00a37 international tracked. \n\nBasically they are lying and stealing the excess postage (which is illegal). \n\nThis company are untrustworthy and do not have the buyer or sellers best interest at heart.

It was sent back to me for free. This month I had a sale cancelled because it was stated that the Chloe bag could not be authenticated. Again no photos no official report which I have asked for and also a charge of 12 EUR to get my belonging sent back to me. Holding back someone's belonging is an offence. I have since tried to transfer via my bank ( which does not allow transfers low like that) and  via Western union which does not allow to send to companies. I am still awaiting for an official report and a different way of paying the 12 eur to get my bag back. Today the expert seller badge was removed and so was the trusted seller one and no email reply re that query. The bag where the sale was cancelled was deleted with no trace from my profile. I know for a fact that a same brand bag was refused from another seller previously and disputed as it was considered a private sale and was later cancelled, re-listed and sold on this sane platform both listings are still there.
