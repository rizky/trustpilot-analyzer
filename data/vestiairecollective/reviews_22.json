Your free shipping credits or promotion vouchers disappear and are lost with cancelled sales. Offers regularly don't work.\nI tried selling, which was an even worse experience. My first item was rejected for one very minor crease on the leather (we are selling second hand goods here). Yet I received an item a day later which had serious non-photographed or described defects (theres no consistency). Today another item rejected because the UK hub can't confirm authenticity! Its obviously authentic, I have been buying and selling Chanel for years I know my stuff. Its insulting and now I have to pay (by bank transfer) to get my authentic item back which can take up to 14 days! Yet fakes are uploaded on a daily basis (supposedly vetted before going live) What a waste of everyone's time.","title":"POOR PLATFORM FOR BOTH BUYERS AND SELLERS!","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=22&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-18","author":"yeung mimi","text":"I feel hopefulness, disappointed and shocked.

TOTALLY UNETHICAL BUSINESS. CHECK THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING.\u00a0\nLike many others below, I've had the worst experience and shall never buy from them again. Please read before buying:\u00a0\n- Bought a vintage YSL bag and paid for the authentication process,\u00a0total \u20ac412. The bag was delivered on December 11th. I used it once before Xmas and then not again until late December due to travels. The second time I used it (I was wearing\u00a0light coloured clothes), I saw some very noticeable stains on my camel coat and grey jumper. I rubbed a white paper on the bag to make sure it was the bag staining before reaching out to VC.\u00a0\n- I made contact on the 6th of January (outside of the return window which is 14 days according T&Cs) and was told I would get a response in 24h. Silence. After 2 chase emails, somebody gets back to me on the 10th asking when the item was delivered, which they could have checked their end, but okay.\u00a0\n- From here, I was asked to provide photos of the damaged clothing and the bag. I sent photos of the stained jumper (the coat was washed and the stain came off). I also sent 2 videos of me rubbing a white paper on the bag to prove it does stain.\u00a0\n- Solution from VC is: sorry you've had a problem but because you're outside of the return window, the only thing we can do is offer you to re-list the product at no cost for you. In other words, become the seller of a faulty product that damages clothes and then assume the risk yourself. \n- they have now told me 3 times to re-list. After I tell them I do not accept this solution, they keep copying and pasting the same reply over and over. Also don't reply to the WhatsApp 'helpline'. \n- As VC refused to provide an acceptable solution, I had to resort to contacting the seller via leaving a message on the original listing. The seller very kindly said she would help via VC. She messaged me yesterday to say she was trying to help but VC told her that there is nothing to do, that I must re-list the bag. WHAT THE HELL!!! \n- So to sum up: 1) VC is not taking responsibility for their clearly faulty authentication process 2) they're asking me to pass on the problem to someone else 3) they're asking me to list and wait an undetermined period of time until I sell it\/if I sell it to recover what I paid for and potentially make a loss 4) alternative is for me to keep a \u20ac400 product that will ruin my clothes 5) Am I being penalised for having worn dark clothing the first time I used the bag and not noticing the issue? How is it logical to have to check for staining on a vintage bag when there's been a paid for authentication process?\u00a06) they are stopping the seller from providing a solution which she is willing to do. \n\nI understand I'm out of the 14 day window but this is not a solution at all. Zero lux experience. \n\nThis company's sole goal is to take the buyer's money, this is where their interest ends. From here, once you have an issue, you're on your own.\u00a0\n\nI shall report this problem to the ombudsman due to the lack of solution from VC.","title":"SCAM - ZERO STARS - STAY AWAY FROM THIS SITE!!
