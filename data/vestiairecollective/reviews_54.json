Christelle P you wanted me to rate our chat. Well I give it 0 stars! Beware buyers, if you place an order and then cancel it before it even ships, then Vestiare will rather continue to have the item ship to them, then ship to you, then you ship back to them, then they ship back to the seller. All the while you\u2019re waiting for a refund and anticipating receiving the item you no longer wanted. The seller has had to ship the item they know full well that you will not be keeping. In that whole process- time, packaging, carbon emissions and no doubt salaries are wasted!! And all because Vestiare wash their hands of any actual customer service and the ability to intervene once you place an order.  My advice for this company would be to actually invest in customer service and a digital platform that works better!!

You should note it does not have a phone number or email to contact them.  Customer service default is an automated chat. After that you may get a live chat or through website email form, which is time consuming. My experience is as follows.  I sold a skirt on June 23rd. It had it listed in assessment for over ten days with no changes or updates.  I contacted Vestiaire through chat.  No update.  I contacted through website email form. No response.  I just did another attempt. It has been crickets. Not worth the hassle. Going two weeks with item listed as assessment progressing.\n\nUpdate 7\/7\/21;  I finally heard back from Vestiaire after initiating another chat.  All the work is on my end to get in touch with them.  I am told they can\u2019t assist me unless I provide a picture ID.  This is unheard of. What type of company wants you to email them your picture ID with so much identity theft taking place. Amazon, PayPal, not even my bloody bank requires this when communicating with them.  Baffling and worrying. So, still no help because I am waiting to see if they will take my gym ID.\n\nUpdate 7\/21\/21: Vestiaire you request that I send you information on the item but you don\u2019t provide information on where to send.  Is there an email??  Also why do I have to provide a picture of government issued ID when not changing account info. I was just asking about information about item that indicates Vestiaire received but no progress. I did not ask for Vestiaire to change anything on my account or use a number or email not affiliated w my account. How is gov issued ID relevant to that. If I call Amazon and state I did not receive a package, they don\u2019t need this info. If I call my bank and state I need a Password reset, they send me an email link at registered email.  They don\u2019t require a copy of government ID. Also, if this information is being shared w customer service abroad you are increasing identity theft risk. Pictures of passports and driver license are not something you give out willy nilly.  Your explanation still does not justify requesting pictures of those documents. Also I am none of these;\n\nA professional seller\nAn individual seller who receives \u20ac2,500 (or your currency equivalent) within a year of receiving your first payment via our new payment system.\n\n7\/29\/21\nSo Vestiaire confirmed receipt of my item on its website but seems to be hung up on some technicality that the item was never scanned for tracking. I am confounded. I mailed the item and Vestiaire confirmed receipt two days later.  Now, they are focused in mail carrier which should not even be an issue. That would only be an issue if they never confirmed receipt of the item.  It is an internal issue with Vestiaire.  Stay far from this company. Apparently received does not mean received with this company.","title":"The customer service is awful","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=54&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-07-07","author":"Anne","text":"Every time I buy something the product all of a sudden is not available anymore.
