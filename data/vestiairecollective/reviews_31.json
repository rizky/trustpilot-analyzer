Says on website zipper not working optimally. Optimally means (not well) I thought it was the little pocket that wasn\u2019t working well, but it was the main pocket for the whole bag. No pictures, no writing which pocket. It should had said \u201czipper broken\u201d! And marked poor condition. \n\nI ordered a Chanel backpack on 11.11.21 that was sold on VC once before by a danish girl. A girl from Romana buys it and relists the item with the same description, but in this description it says nothing about the main zipper is broken! Which is probably why she is selling it again. The bag can\u2019t be zippered up or down it\u2019s stuck and nothing can be in it, as everything will fall out. This was not described or shown in the pictures on the website.\n\nIt was listed as \u201cvery good condition\u201d a item in \u201cvery good condition\u201d is an item that is a second-hand item that is hardly worn and is very well maintained, although it may have slight defects from wear. If the item has defects, they must be mentioned in the description and be visible in photos. (There where no photos showing the broken zipper.)\n\nVC did a quality control on this bag 3 times. This item was checked upon and VC got back to me saying the clasp was off of the bag. The CC zipper clasp.\n\nThey wrote : Our Quality Control team has checked this item and found that there's a tiny difference between the description and the item itself. This minor flaw wasn\u2019t mentioned by the seller in the description, nor was it visible in their pictures. You can read the details in the report from our Quality Control team by clicking below. That said, we still think it\u2019s a wonderful item and a great deal. Our recommendation is that you go ahead with the order but, of course, the choice is yours!\n\nBut the bag has not only a clasp missing which is a tiny and minor detail, like VC says, the whole bag does not function and this they did not tell me nor showed pictures of when doing quality control on the product. This is not a minor detail! This is a huge detail. I seems they didn\u2019t even look at the bag probably. \nThey looked at the product again as I returned it to them and they won\u2019t accept a return and instead offered to relist the item for me again! Like the did for a other seller, that cheated me! They keep putting the item back online with no pictures that show the defect and bad and unclear description which is cheating more buyers.\n \nI won\u2019t pay for an item that is not described right! When I list items I have to upload loads of photos and they want all details, but this bag has 3 photos, no pictures of serial number, no pictures of dirt on interior and no pictures of missing parts nor broken zipper. This listing is not honest and VC doesn\u2019t want the bag back cause they know it\u2019s not probably functioning and they know they can\u2019t sell it. \n\nI paid with klarna and I am no paying for this item!!!! I\u2019m not letting you cheat me and others. \n\nI spoke to Lady Ann A from VC which will take this matter up again. I hope she can talk some since into the \u201cQuality team\u201d as they clearly don\u2019t do there job right.","title":"Chanel backpack with broken zipper","stars":1,"location":"DK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=31&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-03","author":"Nancy","text":"Despite purchasing an item listed as being in the UK and myself being in the UK I have been sent a DHL.

After posting an item I immediately started receiving offers ... 30% off the price I set. I understand all the users there are just looking for a good bargain, but this is insane. I looked through item of same brand posted on VC and found out they sell much more simple things of same type but lower design line for the price twice or even three times higher! So I deleted my item, explaining the issue to a service. I said, I'm sorry but I have to delete my item and than post it back but with higher price because 6 people in 24 hours were just looking to buy my item for 30% less than I rightfully expect to get. And what do you think they did? When I posted my item back, 48 hours after I received a rejection because 'we are not sure your item is original and authentic. send it to us so we can check it and approve it'. Seriously?! So the previous time when few days ago I posted same thing but 30% cheaper you didn't have any question about it's authenticity (which is untruth as I provided all the HR pictures with labels and codes of the product).Hahaha. No way, VC. My advice: use this burglar platform only if you want to get rid of some things you couldn't care less about anymore (but why not just bringing it to charity than right?). In case you own something valuable and want to make a fair deal - avoid Vestiare Collective at any cost. They will take 25% commission plus will drag you to lower your price to ridiculous minimum... so what's the point in dealing with them? Any day (sometimes twice a day!) they will send you notifications like 'drop your price', 'it's a week your item haven't been sold', '10 members added your item in their wishlist so you'd better drop your price and sell!'. Drop your commission down instead...because the service provided doesn't worth it.\nAnd if you're about to buy something on VC... think twice why the price for good label items are SO attractive and approachable (bear in mind 25% commission and think about why would someone sell, for example, 'Aquazzura shoes in perfect condition' for 35 bucks?!'. It's easy right? Probably things are not in that good condition as they're described. Check fair prices for things.

Their authentication check-up is extremely poor. I bought a LV bag and when I received it, the condition was much worse than reflected in the pictures and described. The faults I discovered were not mentioned and neither shown in the pictures. Vestiaire took it back for a second check and said it lived up to their standard accordingly to category. Then i wrote them back with pictures and the specific faults second time. The customer rep said they didn't check those specifics but just a standard check-up. I had 24 hours to decide if i wanted the bag back, or they would just relist the item for the purchase price and charge their usual commission. I am very frustrated as I feel I've been sold a product based on pictures that wasn't reflecting the real condition. Their customer service is poor and slow. So on top of the price paid for the bag, I paid for a quality check-up (as its part of the process when buying) that is extremely poor, plus shipping cost. And their suggestion is to relist the item on the price i bought the bag, using the same pictures so that a next buyer will be in the exact same situation as me. Plus they will charge me their standard commission. So in the end if I decided to accept any of the offers being made on the bag at this point, it will end up costing me equivalent to 150 gbp \/1500 hkd and time for a product that i dont even have.
