I will have to join the chore of bad reviews and people who would give it 0 if they could. \n\nI have received a few present from VC in the past, not being me who bought it and having received pieces I really wanted I decided to join as a seller in order to re-sell some of my loved items. I sold my first Mulberry bag and packed it carefully with the right labelling. The client was based not far off from London so the chosen courier was Hermes. A few days after sending the parcel I receive a message from the buyer who informs me she received a pair of \u00a329,99 Zara trousers instead of the \u00a3160 Mulberry bag. \nThe client shared a picture of the parcel and I luckily also took some before sending the box. The two picture did not match! Proving then that the parcel has been tampered and that the bag has been stolen by someone (Hermes? VC? Who knows!)\n\nFastforward 5 days of chasing VC over the live chat, explaining the happening to every single agent and with the promise that 'someone will email you' or 'rest reassured we are taking care of it' and 'we apologise for any inconvenience' I still have no news of what happened to the bag I carefully packed or about a compensation for losing my item. \n\nAfter reading countless complaints here and on other platforms, it seems obvious to me that VC with a facade of sustainable luxury fashion re-seller is in reality a dishonest company that makes money on the shoulders of those who naively believe they found a bargain, not to mention the lack of professional structured customer service dedicated to the resolution of issues with orders, payments, listings etc.\n\nIf you really are looking for a high end luxury pre-owned item you better off on Ebay or Marketplace.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM VESTAIRE COLLECTIVE!","title":"Fraudulent Company","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=33&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-21","author":"JS","text":"Vestiaire's feedback was incorrect: it took a total of 22 emails to get the description changed. Each time they said in the chat that it was changed, it wasn't, and I finally had to tell them the exact wording in the email. Pathetic ineptitude - and weasely response from them below, as always.\n\n\nVelvet Jacket, Ref. 19047137\n\nAs the seller, I was surprised to see that someone at Vestiaire had changed the description of my jacket without consulting me. In my first contact, approx 4 November with Angela, I was assured the changes had been made. Two further contacts were made, apologies were followed by assurances the changes would be made.\n\nI've just checked and, having three times given the same instructions to change the description back to what I originally wrote, it's still unchanged. \n\nIt still reads 'not just for dressing up' instead of 'not just for fancy dress parties'.\n\nIt still reads designers instead of designer's in the second paragraph. \n\nThe third paragraph - clearly someone's invention - is still there when it's obvious it shouldn't be.\n\nEvery time I've been assured the changes had been made and would be visible in 24 to 72 hours. \n\nThey haven't been. My first complaint was approx 4 November, it's now 21 November; I've wasted a huge amount of time interacting with Vestiaire customer service, always receiving the apology for the inconvenience and always, ultimately, with nothing changing. Pathetic way to treat customers.","title":"Incompetent Time Wasters","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=33&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-21","author":"mary m","text":"So disappointed in vestiaire. I don\u2019t know what happened to this company but definitely they are not doing what they advertise. They cancelled my sale coz I was 1 day late to ship it (it is kind of not my core business to allocate time first thing no matter what). I contacted the most useless chat with them, of course they promised to contact buyer and to sort this out and to relist. Nothing happened - just waste of time in their chat. In 3 weeks I contacted again and also receive loads of promised - nothing happened, wasted 1 hour. Chat alway disappears itself, on the same chat you are getting asked the same questions. I do t understand why it is so complicated to relist the item and to ask the buyer to place order again as it was vestiaire who cancelled the purchase.
