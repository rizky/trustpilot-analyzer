I ordered two items, neither of which have been sent and there\u2019s no way of communicating with anyone. Just a robot on a chat thing who spouts stock answers at you until you go away. The \u2018community of sellers\u2019 is a flawed concept as there\u2019s no way of reviewing them or holding them to account for being rubbish and not responding to you (unlike eBay where you can see each person\u2019s buying and selling background and reviews). And don\u2019t be fooled by terminology like \u2018Trusted Seller\u2019 - all that means is they\u2019ve sold more than two items. No other information about whether they actually sent the items or what the items were like i.e. no buyer feedback at all.\n\nMany of the items are beautiful but overpriced compared to other preloved sites. \n\nI will be removing my account and shopping elsewhere in future.\n\nUPDATE\nA useless response to what I have written above:\n\n1. I did try to contact both sellers more than once and received no response.\n2. You fail to address why your own customer service function is attended by a useless robot.\n3. Sellers actually get 7 days to ship according to the order and, indeed, my order was cancelled on the eighth day so you don\u2019t even know your own delivery terms!\n4. It\u2019s quite incredible that I have tried to get hold of someone at your company to deal with things before being compelled to issue you a one star review here to no avail. And yet the only point you deem me worthy of a response is now. Judging by the reams of one star reviews below this one, I strongly suggest your whole company reviews how it handles its customers and the customer experience with the sole aim of improving things considerably, instead of wasting time issuing pointless responses to poor reviews on Trustpilot.","title":"Shocking","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=21&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-24","author":"JK","text":"I have purchased from VC many times with no problem until they recently opened a new UK authentication center. \nI bought a \u00a33000 Chanel boy bag which the seller's description said no scratch or any sign of wear.

It was chipped off from gold to silver colour. When I looked back the photos, the seller used the chain to cover the damage parts with intention. I contacted VC customer service straight away and the advisor agreed that it didn't not match the description and asked me to post it back.\nHowever, few days later I received an email said the UK quality team had second checked it and it was perfectly matched the seller description (?!!!)

I did not manage to get a refund for this damaged bag.\nThey would only relisted the bag under my profile BUT they have amended the description: marks on metal and stain\/scratch under flap. Excuse me? I thought the UK QC team said it matched the description which had no scratches and sign of wear??\nAlthough the item was resold, I have lost \u00a375 due to QC, postage and process fee.

I recently bought a Cartier love bracelet. I specifically bought from a UK seller since I am also in the UK and because I do not want to pay for custom taxes. I received a notice from the courier asking me to pay for custom fees if I want my item to be delivered because Vestaire needed to authenticate the item in France and then it was sent to me in the UK from France. This is not my problem anymore that Vestaire decided to authenticate it in France. I was not informed of this process of authenticating in France and not in the UK when I bought the item. And this is not the first time I bought item in Vestaire after BREXIT and all of the items I bought in the past were all autheticated by Vestaire as well. To add to the insult, customer service is totally horrible misleading to make the custom fees payment and Vestaire refunding it after the item was delivered to me. Now that I am requesting for a refund which was guaranteed to me before paying the custom fees, Vestaire is saying they will not give me the refund. So frustrating. I have been in contact with their customer service trying to get the refund several times but the agents are unhelpful even cutting off the chat. I will not recommend Vestaire to anybody and I will make sure that nobody will have to experience what I am experiencing now. I will spread word about how bad service Vestaire is. No words to describe how awful this experience is.","title":"Total Fail","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=21&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-25","author":"Michella Malin Petersen","text":"Leaving another review because I am in complete shock at the lack of service from Vestiaire. Their customer service is non-existent. I tried reaching them today via chat and could not bypass their awful service-bot, which was NOT able to help me with my issue. Why are Vestiaire so afraid of helping their clients? They\u2019re supposed to be a luxury site (and they charge a pretty penny for using their services!) yet they have the service level of a dollarstore. I\u2019ve sold an item that I have shipped and Vestiaire hasn\u2019t registered it as shipped. This means that I could lose my sale and money even though the buyer gets the item. And I can\u2019t get through to so much as one person from the customer service team. \n\nVestiaire, you might be selling luxury items but your service absolutely places you in the discount bin. I have shopped (and sold) through alot of sites and your service is, without question, the absolute worst one I have ever experienced.\n\nUpdate: this is EMBARRASING. Not only is the issue still NOT fixed, and my sale will currently be cancelled tomorrow but your customer service representant sent me the wrong mail - a mail meant for internal use - stating that I left a bad review on Trustpilot.\n\n\u201cWe take customer complaints very seriously\u201d no you clearly don\u2019t. And once again, if you cancel my sale, and the buyer still gets the item (which they will, since it\u2019s Direct Shipping), that is theft.","title":"The Collective of bad service.","stars":1,"location":"DK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=21&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-26","author":"Ella","text":"Be very careful when the buyer returns your expensive item as not as described ( spots and damages ). In Vestiaire the item can reported as not suitable up to 72 hours. My Moncler jacket was returned to me as the buyer reported the item in two days stating it had spots what was not true. Vestiaire returned the item to me. When I received the item obviously there were no stains BUT IT SMELT CHEAP PERFUME. The buyer was wearing Moncler jacket probably to show off for two days and later just returned to me as having spots. BE CAREFUL-IT IS NOW A NEW WAY OF RENTING BRAND CLOTHES FOR FREE!! Moreover the buyer returned the expensive item as a piece of rubbish without proper protection and packaging. Vestiaire don\u2019t care! They replied they will warn the buyer.\nPS. Below you will see reply they will refund money when they receive the jacket. One more lie from Vestiare. The received the jacket put on my account as a sale item. But never refunded. So now I am selling again the item, damaged because of the Vestiare, The item is not in  my possession now. As well I have not received the money that they promised.
