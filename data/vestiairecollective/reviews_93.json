This is my second review already where I wanted to summarize my experience. In a nutshell, if everything goes well, it goes well. If something unexpected comes up, you're in trouble. Now point by point.\n\n1) Submitting items. Sometimes listings are rejected and no reason is given why although items can be in very good condition with good photos. Submitted listings can hang in there for days before someone gets onto them and reviews them. On a number of occasions my items were sold even before VC started reviewing them.\n\n2) Attitude to sellers and buyers. After your listing is finally online, people start sending you offers and you accept one of them. However, the buyer can just walk away with no penalty without paying and you can't accept someone else's offer and make a sale. Which brings me to my next point: previously sellers could cancel the sale without penalty within a certain period of time, so overall it was fair. It was really not cool when VC changed rules on the go stripping me off my Expert Badge out of the blue.\u00a0\n\n3) Shipping is normally smooth but when it gets to unusual or very expensive items, the carrier may refuse to take your item with the VC pre-paid label. However, the clock is still ticking and your stats may be affected although it is not your fault completely if you are unable to ship the item. The fun starts with my next point which is...\n\n4) Customer support. Honestly people. Please please do something about it. Just today I had to face some incompetent dude which was rude and helpless despite my very clear request. Gosh, he was not even trying to help or solve a problem. When you write to the chat, you never know are you going to face a jerk or someone reasonable. In a nutshell, it is maybe a 50-50 chance that they will dignify you with the information you need. You have to try writing them a few times before something gets a bit clearer but not entirely clear. Worst attitude to the client I've ever seen.\n\n5) Authentication. My favourite. For goodness sake, if I had full sets for all of my pre-loved items which I source, why the hell would I have needed a third party authentication platform with 25% commission?!! Just ask yourself that question? \"Do you have a receipt?\" - really people??? Chanel necklace with logo and a stamp - you really can't work out whether it is a fake or not without a full set? And this is not the first time. Few examples just to make the readers chuckle.\n\na) sent them a watch. If it was in the HK hub, no authentication, nothing, for a few weeks. They come back to me and ask me for a receipt. Ya, vintage watch. Luckily I had some documents which I sent to them. Ok, I am waiting. Writing to CS because it was already a few weeks, poor buyer waiting - he wanted to buy this watch as a bday gift. Good luck - \"oh your watch is so precious, we really want to take care of it...\". It was a third of the price of some other sales of mine. I started to think that they either broke it or they do not know what to do with it, how to check it. After 1 more week I discovered that watch is in the Paris hub, immediately was authenticated and after some discussions (I have a theory about that as well) sent to the buyer. \n\nb) sent them a pre-owned Chanel top. They got back to me asking for a receipt again. I do not keep receipts for old worn tops!!! Guess what - I had to source similar items online on other websites, I arranged a few collages next to my item showing similarity in tags, seams, fabric. The question is - why did I have to do it?... Why those experts could not work it out themselves?\n\nc) Chanel necklace which is an issue now. They are asking me for a certificate or receipt yet again (after I myself had to chase them multiple times because I only got a notification on my phone about the issue and not the email). Can't you read a stamp? Can't you check against other items you have probably seen before? What sort of expertise level are we talking about here?.. I am so cross and so fed up with this. Updated: ok fine, I sent them proof together with a big magnified photo of the stamp to TWO addresses: their website form and as a response to the support after having a lengthy chat about this issue. Guess what - now they are sending me authentication request asking for an invoice again and threatening me to cancel the sale if I don't send it. What a service for 25% off the sale - you must be joking!\n\n6) payment - no issues here so far. Always quick and on time.\n\nI really do enjoy selling nice pre-owned items and see people happy with their purchases. But frustration dealing with VC kills that joy.\n\nP.S.Yet another update: still no news on authentication. Trying to contact them with supporting materials: they don't even bother with the response, only saying please wait. The buyer started writing angry messages blaming me for delay.","title":"My long review of my experience as a seller","stars":2,"location":"SG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=93&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-10-15","author":"Yumna","text":"They do not respond to you.

As i said in my previous post - they simply do not care. Customer care - useless, careless and rude. From time to time you would get another useless email from a \u201chigher level\u201d. Simply junk filling your mailbox. You can never call or talk to some reasonable person\nFor the last 6 years i have been splitting my time between LA and Bulgaria. Being so I have been using two selling platforms - the real real in USA and VC in Europe (for the simple reason there is no TRR in europe). The difference between the two companies is immensely incomparable. TRR are reasonable, fair and friendly. Just the opposite to VC. In the last 7 months i have been stuck in Bulgaria due to the Global Pandemic so mainly using VC. And i am angry with myself for keep doing so. I have shared some of my worst experiences in my previous posts, of course if i have to share all of them would take hours. No exaggeration. If i can sum it up:\n1\/ customer care - VC do not have such\n2\/ authentication team - they have no idea and no experience. Cannot even make a difference between fake and authentic. At the beginning when i started with VC i had some fun also buying some items, to check it out. When i ended up reselling them - quess what? They questioned their authenticity \ud83d\ude02 really guys? You are so \u201cprofessional\u201d that now you are questioning your own skills? Of course the items were authentic, it was obvious but it is just an example that these people do not know what they are doing. Same time - for obviously authentic items that you try to list they ask for receipts?!?! Who keeps the receipts for clothes , especially when you shop a lot? And if you cannot provide one, the just reject the listing while at the same time you can see they have the same item on their platform. No logic. No consistency. No explanation.\n3\/ rating system - this is a black hole. For example- i ship my items either the same day when they are sold (if sold in the morning) or the next day (if sold in the evening) or in two days (if sold on friday night). Never longer than 3 days after sale. While, according to VC \u201cprecise\u201d computer system my shipping status is 94%. When i contacted them about that, the generated answer was - just ship on time. I sent a screenshot of every single sale from the last 30 showing sale date and ship date clearly showing that there is no delay and asked again - please tell me which one is not shipped on time? Guess what - same robotic answer. Ok, i give up, you win. At the end of the day VC does not fail to disappoint and even takes some pleasure in doing so.\n2\/ comformity - have never and item which is not declared comfort (334 items sold). All of a sudden three days ago a dior sweater with direct shipping to buyer is returned to me because it has holes and it is actually vintage ?!?! First - yes, it has holes, because this is how the model is, three symetrical holes on both sides of the shoulders at the front and on the back. And then - the sweater is from 2016 which is not vintage.  I am NOT blaming the buyer, obviously is not familiar with Dior collections through the years. Not everyone is an expert and nothing wrong with that. But where is the \u201cexpert\u201d VC team in this case to act \u201cprofessionally \u201c and defent the truth? Like always - nowhere. Just pure idleness and carelessness. Direct shipping is a joke where the interest of the seller is not protected. Cannot wait to get it back to see the condition as they give the buyers 72 hours to assess the item and my buyer decided it has holes and is \u201cvintage\u201d at the end of the second day. Again - nothing against the buyer but VC, hello ?!?! As a result - 1 item from 334 declared non-comform and my comformity status goes from 100 % to 98 % ?!?! Can you do math? If VC team cannot obviously their \u201ccomputer \u201c cannot as well. \n3\/ pricing decisions- another joke. I list my items at more than fair price, my decision.  Sometimes, even when there is the same item on their website for double the price they press me to lower my price in order to list it. Why? Because i list from Bulgaria? Yes, sorry, i am an american working in Bulgaria. And for you Bulgaria is a scam? This is pure discrimination\nAnd i can go on and on but i think there is no use. It is frustrating,it is waste of time,there is no security. And when it goes bad nobody is willing to help you. I do not understand the reason for it neither do I understand how they can not care at all despite the copy\/paste answers that they put here which are non-sense.\nNow, i also expect they to punish me a deprive me of my badge because this is another specialty of VC - you share negative experience, then they punish you. Which is a good attempt to try to silence you and also to discriminate.But it is a matter of time TRR to open their European branch and than VC will not have the monopoly.And will be forced to improve. But why wait for that?

I don't normally bother to write reviews but this has just appalled me so much, I needed to make others aware. \n\nAs a buyer - i spent several thousand on a bag, it turned out to be fake. It was 'checked' by VC but it was clearly fake, incorrect stamping and smelt and felt wrong. Anyway, after some sleepless nights i managed to return it and they gave me a refund (thank god). So bad that i got a fake, but good i managed to return it. Bad that i have still seen the item for sale on the site. \n\nOther items - i purchased something with a gem missing (quite noticeable as on jewellery) but was not mentioned on the listing, or by the VC 'checking team'.

Nothing I have attempted to order from them has made it to my door. Items are rarely sent, then you need to wait almost a month before they issue you a refund. And if they are sent, the postal services they use are unreliable, and it can take months to arrive, or be labeled as \u00ab\u00a0lost\u00a0\u00bb. In those cases, you as the buyer need to contact VC to demand a refund. Customer service is awful, finding it on the app or uploading something using the app can be a disaster. They purposely make it difficult to contact them when something goes wrong (and it almost always does). They do not take any accountability for the limitations of the app and website design features. As a seller, they take a huge percentage cut of my sales, which I understand and accept, but they will reject items if you set a price they deem too \u201chigh\u201d, even though you can do a quick search and see that there are usually Hundreds of items like yours that have already sold for \u201chigher\u201d price points. Buyers can make offers but every communication you have with them has to be \u201creviewed\u201d. This delays sales because by the time the buyer receives the information they asked for, they have often moved on. As a \u201cTrusted Seller\u201d who sends things under 2 days of purchase, I can lose my status as a seller if I fail to send something 1x within 1-2 days. Also, after the buyer has picked up an item that has been sent from me, they can take weeks to confirm, as it seems there is NO communication between the shipping services they use and VC. I am still waiting to be paid for an order I sent a month ago, which was received less than 5 days after I sent it. Honestly, after taking such a huge cut for doing nothing but bringing headaches to my sales, it\u2019s not so much to ask that VC start taking accountability and following through with their shipping services.
