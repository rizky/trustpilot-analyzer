I spent more than 420 euro for a famous branded necklace, and I paid for the authentication fees, and the necklace arrived with the clasp ripped off.\n\nI've been sending them emails for 5 weeks now, talking on their chat, sending proofs because they asked me for a sworn statement, a copy of my ID, pictures of the necklace, tags, package, etc... everything to discourage me....\nBut far from being discouraged I provided everything, and then, no more answer for a week, big silence.... and since then I receive impersonal emails asking me to wait another 72 hours, always the same emails and never any answer.... another 72 hours, again and again...\nIn short, I'm being taken for a ride and told that I will be taken care of, that I will not be forgotten and that my problem will soon be taken care of, etc... \nin fact they don't solve anything, but they send me a little email every 10 days telling me to wait, but still nothing...\n\nSo I find myself without anyone to talk to because no phone number is available on their site and without the possibility to send back my broken necklace, and without my lost money of course. \nIt's distressing considering the huge margins they take, both on the sellers' side and on the buyers' side, I know it from experience because I've been on both sides. Compared to other sites I use. I do not recommend Vestiaire anymore.\n\nSo the conclusion of this sad experience, is that they have a very bad after sales service (non existant), coupled with a bad product verification team, and a lack of respect for the customer.

However, this experience have turned me away from them forever.\nI have bought an hermes bag charm from them for over EUR 500 which was fine.  But they decided to post it through a local carrier which is still fine as long as it delivers the results (in my case it doesnt).  I have purchased the item since 24th Feb and i still havent received it.  The biggest issue was when the delivery updates stopped for 5 days, i used their customer chat service on the 13th day after purchase, and was told i should get back to them when i havent received it on the 15th day.  i remember asking them \"so i shd get back in 2 days (11th March)\" and they said \"yes\", and only to find out their customer chat service suspended until the 16th.  I honestly struggle to believe on the 9th March they didnt know at that point they were going to close chat service the next day.  \nThe local courier has since then, updated the status to say part of the delivery details were missing and they are contacting the sender!! so knowing that customer service is non existent, i have decided to use the local courier chatbot (which i cannot because it's only in french) and i called their international number (with my own money) which was then diverted to a voice mail message also all in french).  In all honesty, i paid EUR 500 which i dont consider cheap, why couldnt they post with a more international courier with customer support who speaks english? it is not a EUR 10 T shirt.  If u want to save on customer service support, i would honestly suggest u choose a courier who will give you less issues.  so after 3 weeks, i am still seeing nothing, heard nothing and not sure if my item will ever turn up.  If you consider buying from Vestiaire just be prepared that they a) cannot guarantee to use DHL\/ UPS\/ Fedex as quoted by their customer services and b) when that happens ure on ur own, their customer service is pretty non existent.  Lucky i only got a bag charm, imagine if u paid thousands of dollars on a bag? it is surely gonna stress u out.","title":"I have bought and sold several times on\u2026","stars":1,"location":"HK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=68&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-03-11","author":"Georgina Kane","text":"I have been chasing up a refund for import charges I received and that I was assured before I paid them that I would be reimbursed.
