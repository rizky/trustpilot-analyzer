Secondly, their staff are appalling! I closed my account with them and unsubscribed to emails. I continued to be harassed with marketing emails. No matter how many times I clicked \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 I kept getting emails (this goes against the GDPR law by the way). So I contacted their \u2018help\u2019 section, at which I received a message that I could not reply to - to tell me I need to unsubscribe through my account. I DONT have an account because I came to my senses and deleted it! So how can I cancel my subscription through that - stupid staff. Anyway, I turned to social media to POLITELY ask someone to help me.. and they deleted my comment because they\u2019re obviously hiding behind how they treat people! Don\u2019t delete comments, deal with the problems. This company is an unbelievable joke. How anyone shops or sells on there is beyond me. I managed to contact their data law department (yep, this is how far you have to go to something simple sorted) and they emailed me and said they are unsubscribing me and it might take 70 days.

Both orders just vanished from ups shops and never turned up, been missing for weeks! Weeks of me chasing Vestiaire for cancelling the order and begging them to refund me! First time it took a month to get back a large sum of money, we\u2019re speaking almost \u20ac12000 here (order #45086247) Now it\u2019s over \u20ac2000 and the same scenario repeating again, is it a coincidence?

I was originally sold a fake that did go through their \u201cexpert evaluation\u201d. Upon realization and having a real life expert have a second evaluation, it was undoubtedly a fake and so I tried returning it. And I mean the whole process of trying to return it is absolutely ridiculous. I\u2019ve spent countless hours on their support chat, sending emails and having technical difficulties with their site which truly needs an upgrade. Finally had got it sent after 2 months, only to have them write that it \u201cmatches the sellers description\u201d making it eligible to sell again and be relisted on my account. Yes it might match the sellers blurry and vague description, but in no way was that bag authentic. I felt very bad for the next buyer of my bag, and for their sake, I\u2019m hoping that it truly is real. On top of that, the email I got had said that I would receive \u201cthe full proceeds of the sale, minus our usual commission\u201d, I mean how misleading can that sentence be? I understood that I would receive FULL payment, but after just having a long chat with a Vestiaire Employee, I was told that was not the case and that they\u2019re sorry that I got confused. I never thought that I would be gaslit by a company until now. Not only did I waste an incredible amount of time with this site, but I\u2019m not getting all my money back. I will never recommend this site to anyone. Now I just hope to receive the payment (that\u2019s minus the \u2018usual commission\u2019) and move on. So much unnecessary stress. One last thing, there were times when the support chat were helpful, efficient and reassuring, but there were times when i was absolutely in awe in how absurd they were. I mean once, I couldn\u2019t hold a conversation with one guy, who wrote complete gibberish and another time, I asked an employee a simple question and she obviously did not know the answer so then she just left the chat, without saying anything.
