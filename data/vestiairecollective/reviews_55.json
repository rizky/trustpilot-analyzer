They were all placed online after a few email exchanges and real people checking my items.\n\nMy understanding is that it is either AI or someone junior who is reviewing the items at the initial check. So my strategy was to make them \"escalate to the expert team\" in order for them to actually look at the items and see that they are authentic.\n\nFrom my last upload, 6 items were refused as Vestiaire Collective \"could not determine authenticity\".\nFine, I am writing to the customer support, it is escalated to the \"expert\".\n\nHere is the response of the CS and \"expert\":\n\"Our expert team reply in my email. \nHere is the report why your item is refused.\nHello\n16578120 finish, engravure, et box NOT CONFORM\n16575357 same\n16575321 same \n16558233 finish NOT CONFORM\n16558515 finitions NOT CONFORM\n Base to our expert team We can't accept it.\n\nWe hope to see the new listing from you.\nThank you.\n\nChristian from Vestiaire Collective.\"\n\nI always doubt myself in case I missed out on something and who knows, maybe I overlooked something in some items but all items are common models which authenticity is so obvious to me.\nThe most bizarre issue here that, for example, item 16578120 above was just serviced by Chanel Singapore. Not just serviced, but I dropped it off and collected it personally and I paid for the servicing with my own card.\nI have provided super clear photos of the earrings and photos of BOTH receipts: collection slip and receipt with payment of 65 SGD, my details, my signatures, item model number on it etc. Even the pic of the slip I took IN CHANEL ITSELF while collecting. Everything was provided.\n\nIf I could, I would be very happy to share hallmarks for all the items just to show what I am talking about because I have zero doubt with their authenticity.\n\nThe reason I am writing this all here is that there was an actual person from the \"expert\" team (not the customer support folk who can't even speak English) who actually looked at the items and concluded all of them are fake. Despite hallmarks, super clear photos and documents from the original brand provided.\n\nThis clearly shows not even the level of expertise but its total and absolute absence, stupidity, zero knowledge of the brand and lack of skills to do some basic research. This is all despite the fact that the items are pretty basic, these are not some rare vintage unknown models - no, there is nothing really special about them.\n\nStill, Vestiaire Collective is unable to recognise authentic pieces despite being provided with the sufficient information to do so.\nI really wanted to make this public for everyone's awareness. \nDespite the fact that everyone knows that they do pass fakes but pointing their dirty stupid fingers at authentic items, calling them fakes and placing themselves ABOVE THE ORIGINAL BRAND in terms of expertise - this is not a viable business model.\n\nWith the absence of the brand knowledge, I believe they have no right to do any sort of authentication service if the skill literally does not exist. I will also be reaching out to Chanel representatives to raise concerns over Vestiaire Collective selling and \"authenticating\" Chanel products without any capabilities to do so.","title":"Experts without expertise","stars":1,"location":"SG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=55&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-06-17","author":"Natalia","text":"Worst experience!

Everyone of course is looking for bargains in VC. The prices are originally inflated as buyers expect discounts, even very steep discounts. VC allows for requesting 30% discount on the asking price of a listed item but at the same time VC also pushes sellers to lower their prices if their items don't get sold asap. I have seen items that were originally for sale for 500\u20ac, getting sold for 150\u20ac or less. VC is whistling blissfully with a flat 15\u20ac commission from any sale up to approx.150\u20ac and percentages for sales above 150\u20ac. So if a seller has let's say listed a nice but non-sign\u00e9 leather belt for 60\u20ac it is likely s\/he will actually sell it at around 20-40\u20ac which means that s\/he would barely make a profit of 5\u20ac which doesn't worth the trouble at all if you consider handling and shipping. One would do it for the fun of it, but VC makes the serious money, not the average seller. VC is also replete with professional sellers who don't sell items from their wardrobes (2nd hand) but merchandise stock (items still with tags). These professionals probably also make some good enough money. What is attractive at VC is the seer volume of items on offer. But bear in mind that if you pay 25\u20ac for a silver ring that you really liked and waited to get on discount from let's say the 100\u20ac it was originally listed, that does not necessarily mean you got a real bargain! The ring might in close look seem worth less than 25\u20ac. VC charges extra for quality control and if you end up with an unwanted item ... bad luck! You may relist it for the money you paid and commission-free .... BUT it is likely that nobody will buy it for what you payed; everyone will want a discount!

I take all the responsibility to all the information I have here, and I kept the emails and chat history as well:\n\nI\u00b4m an expert seller on Vestiaire. \n\nOn 06\/07\/2021, I shipped the brand new with tag dress to my buyer, who lives in Germany.\n\nOn 06\/09\/2021, the buyer received the dress. (info via DHL)\n\nOn 06\/11\/2021, the buyer reported a stain problem, but she didn\u00b4t upload any photo of the stain. (info via email from Vestiaire and chat) \n\nAfter the day 06\/11, I contacted their team almost everyday, especially on 06\/18 through email, to sent them high quality photos and a packing video of the dress, all these evidence proof that when the dress being packed, it was clean and brand new.\n\nOn 06\/18\/2021, their agent Garry O. confirmed in the online chat that according to the DHL tracking info, the buyer had sent the dress to their Paris expert team and they\u00b4re waiting for its arrive. Also he replied my email that they had received my photos correctly and if there were any updates, they would let me know.\n\nOn 06\/21\/2021, I contacted them again through chat, wanted to see if there was any photos of the stain, the agent at the time confirmed still not, they were still waiting for the buyer to upload the evidence.\n\n2 hours later, I received a message from DHL, saying that there\u00b4s a return package for me from Germany, the buyers address.\n\nSo I contacted Team Vestiaire on chat, they started to trying to close the chat and promised me that if we talk through email because it will be more efficient.\nAt the same day afternoon 06\/21, I received some photos from the buyer, and I asked them to mark the stain for me because I couldn't find any. \nAt 10PM, their agent Vanessa Nacion replied my email, didn't answer any of my requests, and telling me that is the \"direct shipping\" policy that the buyer can choose a return because the dress is dirty.\n\nSo I carefully checked their \"direct shipping\" policy online, it has one sentence: \"Whilst waiting to know more, your payment will be placed on hold and we\u2019ll let you know the outcome within 7 days.\"\n\nI have all the evidence that the case was opened on 06\/11, and I received the outcome on 06\/21. \n\nThe solution is simple, I didn't get the outcome on time, I get paid.\n\nToday is 06\/22\/2021, They never replied my last email.\n\nI think I was tried to be reasonable.\nHere is my experience, and I always take detailed photos and packing video just in case for anything complicated.
