They won't get back to me or give me any indication of where my shoes are. \n\nI sent my shoes in. A pair of gucci tennis 1977 high top black. I purchased them in Miami and I couldn't take the box me on thr flight so I ditched it and packed my shoes. Fast forward to the sell of the shoes on Vestiairecollective.com. \n\nNow I put the shoes in a replacement box because I threw away the original box to back them in my luggage. The shoes were packed in a authentic gucci box from another pair of gucci shoes. The item was sent directly to the buyer. Buyer raised questions of authenticity because it wasn't the original box. \n\nVestiairecollective.com was sent the shoes and hasn't returned them at all and won't give me explanation to why they won't. Customer service says they are sitting in a warehouse. Why???? I've chatted with 6 different customer service representatives and they all say they email me. I complained everyday to them with no results. I'm considering filing a law suit against Vestiairecollective.com for theft. Vestiairecollective.com has had more enough time to send my item back give me a reason to why it's being held. \n\nVestiairecollective.com gives the buyer 72 hours to file a complaint which in my opinion is to long. Buyer could wear them, send them back, with a full refund and now the seller is stuck with a used shoe and get penalized. Not fair. \n\nHopefully Vestiairecollective.com see this and finally want to do their damn jobs. I don't recommend people sell on this site. Communication is terrible and your not actually talking to anyone directly. Maybe through the chat service but they'll jus tell you they will contact you by email.

After chatting with a seller who said she sent me an offer, the offer was the listing price. As we discussed more, I learned she was offering me 1750 euros which should be $1880 but in my end it was showing up $2035. No one in customer service could help me. They wash their hands and say a third party handles the billing. I realized you can change your settings to another currency. When I changed to Euros, there it was, listed at 1750 euros. I have a MasterCard with zero foreign transaction fees so I purchased it in Euros. I got an email confirming my purchase. When I tell the seller I\u2019m so excited for the item, she tells me she hasn\u2019t received a shipping label. Customer support said they were verifying payment and if they needed supporting documents, they would email me. The account is in my name. Everything matches so I didn\u2019t worry. 4 days go by and still nothing. Customer support keeps telling me they\u2019ll email me after forwarding to their \u201cexperts\u201d but nothing. On the 5th morning, the seller emails me saying her item is showing back on sale. When I look at my order status it says \u201ccancelled by seller.\u201d Seller says it wasn\u2019t her. Customer support says they can\u2019t verify my payment and have cancelled. Seems like they want to pocket the extra money from the exchange rate and since I found a way around it, they decided to cancel my order and blame the seller. Again, was told I\u2019d get an email. They still haven\u2019t refunded my money or communicated what they couldn\u2019t \u201cverify\u201d if the account is valid and mine!","title":"Pocketing higher exchange rates","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-19","author":"Allison Brody","text":"Do not use Vestiaire, they will steal your money.  I live in the UK and recently sold three items on their website to three buyers in the UK.  My total sales were 212.14 pounds and taking into account their selling fee (12%) and processing fee (3%), I should have received 174.57 pounds.  However, when they paid me, I received 134.44 pounds.  I emailed them to ask them about the missing 40 pounds they owed me and they said it was because of currency conversion fees.  That makes no sense to me as I was selling it within the UK.  It is very un-transparent, as they did not tell me what currency these people whose addresses were in the UK decided to purchase my items with and even so - there should be a disclaimer about conversion fees that are almost 20% of the total sale price!  I think they are not being honest and are using that as an excuse to skim money off of customers.   As there are many more resale platforms around now, I will no longer be using Vestiaire.","title":"Do not use Vestiaire - they steal your money","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-19","author":"Ank Andrei","text":"after they received my item to their hub they didn\u2019t send it and it passed more than 1 month, l began to write them and after 4 chats support(all useless), 6 email they had the same respond\u201dtheir expert team\u201d is working. l asked for a refund nothing happened.","title":"item lost in their hub and no refund","stars":1,"location":"RO","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-20","author":"Viv","text":"TOTALLY HOPELESS\n\nnot capable of figuring out basic errors \n\nI\u2019ve seen chip shops run more smoothly the Vc\n\nIncapable & Hopeless \n\nDon\u2019t believe the FAKE reviews who in there right mind enjoys talking to bots","title":"TOTALLY HOPELESS","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-20","author":"email addy","text":"Soooooo tired of going around and around in circles \nNow day 7 off asking to reactivate my account as understandable got fed up with all the error abd hassle VC made, so deactivated  then decided since none of which was my fault abd I\u2019ve put Soooo much effort in ( 600 plus item)  I decided I would reactivate again ( give me strength, I shouldn\u2019t lose out when Ive put in so much effort, now, after 7 days of asking,  messaging etc etc NOTHING- still not active!!!!\nEVERY day being told it will be 24 hours now is 7 days , this is not a good way to treat good sellers I\u2019ve lost a lot of sales again \nReactive account and stop messing up","title":"Soooooo tired of going around and\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-20","author":"Annie Greenberg","text":"Support for DHL paperwork, printing shipping labels,& long unresolved chats, all going nowhere, I had high hopes that this would be professional.
