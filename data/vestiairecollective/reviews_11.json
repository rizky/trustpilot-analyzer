I just purchased $3005.26usd worth of clothing and shoes. I know crazy. But I wanted to give them a chance. Today I saw there was a complaint made from Vestiaire Quality control. I went to their \u201cHelp\u201d area to ask why they were shipping something that has a ligitiment, in writing, complaint on it. They were expensive Isabel Marant shoes. I spent about 5mins with Leo their BOT, questioning what I wanted and I finally said Agent. So I got someone maybe human?(A.S initials of her mane)She was speaking English I did not understand so I asked for a fluent English speaking person. She refused to transfer me. I asked for a manager 3-4x\u2019s because I was getting anywhere with her. She said a couple times there is no complaint. I said \u201ca complaint in English means something is wrong. What does it mean in French!? She told me to look up the definition up in Google.She then ended the chat which it felt like I was hung up on. Not only did I throw a bunch of cash into Vestiaire\u2019s Bank including $650 more with of fees, again crazy me!, I have been in the fashion business for 30 years. I found Aiza Actions so unconscionable.

Everything went as it should, until my package was out for delivery, but wasn\u2019t for some unknown reason. I tracked it through their app, but the status of the package stayed unchanged. After about two weeks I contacted Vestiaire to ask about the package, but I didn\u2019t get an answer. I then contacted the courier, and was told my package was lost, and they couldn\u2019t find it. After I talked to the courier my package status on the Vestiaire app updated and said it was delivered. I then contacted them again, saying the courier told me the package was lost, so how was it possible that they could change the status. Instead of looking into it they wanted me to send a handwritten letter confirming I never received it. They even wanted my neighbors to write one. And this is in spite off the delivery address wasn\u2019t even my address but a courier parcel box. After sending the mail with all the requested information I never heard anything back from them. A couple of weeks went by, and I received a text from the courier saying they found my package. When picking it up the package was soaked and ruined, and the coat I ordered was sticking out. I then, again, contacted Vestiaire with pictures of the package. Again, they informed that I had to send them a handwritten letter confirming this statement. I did as asked, and haven\u2019t heard a word back since, except from their automated email saying \u201cWe\u2019ve not forgotten you - we\u2019ll be in touch in the next 24(or 72) hours.\u201d I\u2019ve since contacted them again and again, but still - and as expected - no answer.
