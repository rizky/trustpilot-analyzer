PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THIS WEBSITE. You have to know your designer key authentication marking to not fall victim to knock off. \nI have several designers and we did our checks from the pics posted with the description. I ordered a very beautiful Fendi swimsuit. As soon as it arrived I checked the piece for key marking. I found some discrepancies. I notified VC. They ask that I ship the swimsuit back for a second inspection. They ask for pics of the discrepancies. This item was shipped right back to me with no additional information concerning my concerns. I chat with a VC rep. She said the second inspection also said the item was authentic. I ask can you tell me who inspected and did they look at my pics of the discrepancies. She said nope no info to share on the second inspection. She said if it was shipped back it is real. WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUES I HAVE WITH THE KEY MARKINGS. I expected to receive an email or something posted to my VC account about the second inspection. For all I know they could have just shipped it right back without even looking at the swimsuit. this was poor customer service. I closed my account and deleted the app from my phone. I realize the seller can say whatever they want about their items. Once you pay for it the seller ship it to VC and VC CHECK IT ACCORDING TO THE DETAILS LISTED FROM THE SELLER. I WONDER WHO IS CHECKING FOR THE CUSTOMER. Think about your customer. Also you have to pay to have them to authenticate the item. TRR and FPhile do not charge to authentic the item.
