They still claim the courrier lost it...\n\nDon't send your items to them better use EBAY or other websites. VC customer service is terrible. They don't reply back in time. Closed their phone number, no live agents basically they loose your items and then thats it.\n\nSee below my letter to them, which they ignore \n\n\n\nDear Support,\n\n\nRegarding the status for item Lace mid-length dress Dolce & Gabbana (r\u00e9f. 210166**) that you (Pinky) claims was never sent.\n\n\n\nOn the 3th of March VC sent me a shipping label (GBR 807 6-00)\n\nOn the 6th of March at 11AM, I dropped off a dress at Hermes with a shipping Label that was sent to me on 3 March. (Hermes Code P94661**)\n\nOn Wednesday 9th of March 18:32 the dress was delivered by Hermes at Crawley VC center, signed off by the receptionist. See attached confirmation on Hermes courrier website with the code P94661**. The parcel number barcode is T01Y5A00004430** and clearly refers to VC Crawley with shipping label (GBR 807 6-00)\n\nThere is evidence from Hermes that it was dropped off and received by your receptionist especially as parcels are tracked with barcodes. It is therefore rubbish to say the parcel was never sent or lost in the mail. Feel free to check on Hermes website and you can clearly see it was delivered and signed off by VC reception.\n\nIt seems VC Crawley lost my 2000 USD dress. There are some reports online that staff at VC are stealing items but that is not my issue. You have my dress and lost it. \n\nI am particularly very upset that you claim your clients lost it or Hermes did, which are un based hurtful\u00a0allegations\u00a0which are very bad for your business and trust in\u00a0Vestiaire\u00a0Collective. Your company should be trustworthy as you store many expensive items from clients and if VC employees are stealing, send items that are a massive breach of trust. I will never use your company's services anymore and if you don't\u00a0pay me back. I will ask my social media to publish these details online which will cost you many clients.\n\n\nIf someone at VC is contacting me again please make sure its management as sorting these minor issues is taking weeks and I am not used to people taking me for an idiot saying items are not sent or lost when the evidence is there.\n\n\nSee attached all confirmations.\n\n\nI await your reply and payment.\n\n\nBR","title":"RE My 2000 USD dress got stolen or lost\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=10&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-22","author":"Zara Egan","text":"I ordered 3 things from VC in one go.

I registered on their website, and initiated a chat. Without even having typed a single word, in chat, I was banned from chat, for \"breach of their terms of service\".\n\nSecond. Their description of the jacket says \"never worn\", while the google thumbnail and its description say \"used\".\n\nI wanted to have certainty about the jacket's condition, so I had a chat session about this with Jerald. This is a different chatline from the one I was banned from (the chat I was banned from is a chat line with the owner of the jacket, if I understood correctly). Jerald told me that, in order to determine if the jacket is new, or used, I have to buy it, pay for it, so that it then is sent to their warehouse for inspection. Which is ridiculous, all the more since the item description on their webpage includes that \"it has been verified and authenticated by their experts\".\n\nAfter all this, earlier today, I noticed, which I didn't before, that the photo clearly shows creases at the elbow, proving that it HAS been worn, and is not \"never worn\". So google was correct, and the \"verification and authentication by their experts\" a dodgy affair.\n\nI made a substantial offer on that jacket prior to noticing this, but there's of course no way I'm going to pay the amount I offered for a second hand jacket.","title":"I stumbled upon their website through a\u2026","stars":1,"location":"BE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=10&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-23","author":"Louise Payne","text":"I am awaiting a refund for goods paid for on 25th February 2022 , lost by Hermes on 2nd March and despite numerous emails from Vestiaire & me replying asking for a refund - nothing.
