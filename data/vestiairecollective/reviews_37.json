This is very abbusive and illegal behavihour. Their contract with the sellers say that they have to disptach the items within 7 days to be able to keep the sale and 5 days to be able to fit into your expert programme. Nevertheless, the whole thing is a lie, because their delivery service does not work and their customer service is like a collection of boots. They do not count the time that the seller takes to dispatch the item to them (their contract with the seller) but rather the deliver time of the carrier. Therefore, if the delivery company is delayed or looses the item, the seller pays the bill. This is a very dangerous company. I have worked with them for 6 years or so, but their service is going down the hill. I beleive that they will shut down soon. Also, their authentication service is a failure like everyone says. It happened to me having the same item certified as authentic and replica several times. Also, previous workers at the company, left the company and emailed me on my private email to offer their services. So, you know how dodgy it is.","title":"Very dangerous company","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=37&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-28","author":"Magda","text":"Since they started using Hermes my experience had been absolutely horrible.

I despatched all my items within 24 hours. I didnt realise that some of my items were shipped to so called ' collection points', in fact those places turned out to be Tabacconists. I was waiting on average 3 weeks until a buyer bothered to collect their parcel. Needless to say, I wasnt paid until the item was collected plus 3 days for feedback. The label didnt indicate the item was going to a 'collection point'. 2.Vestiaire uses return labels for forward shipping. It means as a seller 'you returned unwanted item' and can make no claim against a carrier. Sold items leave your possession with Vestiaire shipping labels but they refuse to take responsibility for shipping mishaps. On one occasion I had to wait for about 6weeks for a payment after the item went astray. I told Vestiaire to pay me and then make a claim as shipping was their responsibility but they took no notice. 3. The vast majority of DHL points dont accept returns, only forward  shipping thus I had to travel 20 miles to one point only that was accepting return labels. 4. I asked to send me a UPS label 2 mins walk from my home, they refused. 5. On one occasion they sold my item during the pandemic. I tried to cancel a sale unable to find a place accepting a DHL return label, web site malfunctioned and after 8 attempts cancellation failed. My item was in my orders and I was virtually harassed by reminders to ship the item. Eventually I travelled 20 miles and posted the item with a live valid label. A week after shipping they told me that they had refunded the buyer because I tried to cancel the sale. Remember that AFTER THEY REFUNDED THE BUYER the item was sitting in my orders, I was relentlessly reminded to ship and the shipping  label was live. Of course I had no idea that they had refunded the buyer. 6. As a seller you will be incessantly pursued to reduce the price. 7. Vestiaire charged me a \u00a3100 commission fee on a \u00a3380 transaction. I suggested that instead of harassing a seller to reduce the price, they might facilitate a sale by reducing their commission fee.8. Petty nitpicking about my new Prada bag stalled the sale because arguably the dimensions of a large tote were 2-5cm  larger or smaller, not sure. How does it sound to you? And that's not all. I sold 25 items, dont remember one smooth transaction; highest final value fees worst service. And dont remind me of their 'expertise', mind blowing undervaluations and overlooked faults in purchased items.\nHow on earth Vestiaire gets 3\/4 stars?????

You have to fill in the enquiry form and hope and pray someone replies to you.\n\nAfter getting a response and going back and forth with one of their customer service team - I\u2019m left with no choice but to leave a bad review. It\u2019s been 4 weeks since I sent out my items and I have neither my boots or the payment. \n\nI am repeatedly informed by a copy and paste email of the information provided by Hermes on 14th October - that my items are being returned to me when they are clearly lost and the tracking has not been updated.\n\nI am unable to contact Hermes myself as I no longer have the postcodes for the deliveries - I used Vestiaire\u2019s pre paid shipping labels as they arranged the delivery - I cannot contact Hermes without the postcodes.
