The item is compliant, rather the due diligence around where the  product was showcased on your platform was not....a personalised email highlighting the error would have been far more appropriate, acknowledging your mistake. \n\nWhy was the item listed to someone in the country that the material is not exportable? \n\nWhy should I be out of pocket for this poor experience? I have sold multiple items and am a trusted seller. \n\nWhy was I advised that the issue would be escalated and I would receive a response whilst soon after this interaction via live chat I received a text message from DHL to say I had a parcel in transit from VC due to arrive in a few days. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to say VC but you have a long way to go when it comes to customer communications and experience.","title":"If you enjoy automated emails and chat bots this platform is for you!","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=57&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-05-27","author":"Rita D","text":"The first time I have sold something via VC.

The link does not work. I sent an email and no one replied. Contacted someone via chat; it was useless. So, how can I solve this?? Every time that you have an issue, things spiral quickly, as it seems that you are dealing with puppets, not customer assistants. There is no responsibility.

Unfortunately when trying to pay - import duties of amount over 200 EUR pops out (UK). Instead of paying 1150, total price is 1350 EUR... it is crazy that such a company with such a huge selling margin cannot afford to cover such import duties, especially that item is delivered to the authentication Center. Your customer service has never managed to resolve any of my issues. Could you please support our buyers\/sellers more?

As of now I have been expecting my payment for already a month. I contacted the customer service twice through the chat bot and I managed to get in touch with operators, not the bots. (You just have to push twice that bot wasn\u2019t helpful). And each of them told me that the payment is scheduled in 3-5 working days. I said: I should have recieved it 3 weeks ago! And they: you will receive it in 3-5 working days. But I also got the information that the problem was with PayPal. So what? They have a problem, why should I suffer? Even if I am waiting for only 8\u20ac that is still unacceptable! I am not going to sell with VC till I get paid and probably even if I will get finally paid.
