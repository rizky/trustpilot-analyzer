I am a first time buyer. I bought a bag 7 days ago. Firstly I was sent a \u00a320 voucher as a welcome to use which I applied. Just before I sent payment which showed the full balance and delivery address I took a screenshot. After I sent payment VC took the full payment and didn\u2019t apply the discount and then the delivery label had a random delivery address on. I have been contacting them solidly twice a day for 7 days to get this address changed to my home address and to the address on the invoice. They sent through a new invoice to the seller which again had a random incorrect delivery address. I keep getting told this will be resolved within 24 hrs. This is still on going and have just been told it will be another 3 days!! It has been flagged to their expert team\u2026 what a joke that team are. Expert on winding people up and lying and been incapable of sending out a shipping label. It\u2019s not rocket science it is basic admin!! I have never ever dealt with such an appalling company in my life. They have rang me and then didn\u2019t speak & then emailed to say nobody answered or that I hung up!! All I want is the bag that I payed for!! It looks like the only option for me is for me to have the bag delivered to a random address, travel there which is not a safe area and hope that they are honest enough to give it to me. I don\u2019t even know who actually has my money!! I am now convinced that all communication is a robot and there is nobody human on the chat. This will not be a company that I will use again.

Every time I order an item now my item gets cancelled and reappears the next day for 10 times the price. This has happened 6 times in 6 months. The problem is that VC still allows buyers to message sellers AFTER an item has been sold. I know a lot of people messaging on chat after an item has been sold still manage to persuade the seller to sell outside of vestiare collective. The point is the chat function should not be allowed after an item sells. It's not just the buyer who misses out but VC too as buyers use all sorts of techniques to persuade sellers to sell outside of VC for high value items.

Somehow VC does not grasp that just posting polite promises on trustpilot, will not stop customers of calling them out on their nonsense. VC, polite answers mean nothing when they are not followed up by actions. Nobody expected you to keep your promise in the comment in reply to my last comment about yet another ridiculous experience with you, but i would say - would be much more dignifying if you just stop publishing lies about the actions that you would take to fix the problems that you create. Just empty words are not going to bump up your ratings, because luckily truspilot offers a platform where people are free to share their experiences with VC. And as all can see, there is a pattern of repetition of the negative experiences the customers have. Worse and worse and VC totally unwilling to improve. Just the opposite- the \u201cquality \u201c of their service is sinking down together with the trust in the company.","title":"Resolved as well","stars":2,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=40&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-17","author":"Hebah Bibi","text":"Worst customer support.

I wish I had checked TP before using VC again. I have only ever sold on VC and I was extremely impressed when I used them in 2018. I just sold 3 Mulberry bags, one went temporarily missing with UPS (eventually located thank goodness and the buyer has it) but the VC Customer Service was wholly useless. And now, even though supposedly there is a 72 hour window, 11 days later, another item I sold is being returned to me. How did I find out? An email from VC, as you might expect? No. Via UPS telling me a package is en route. Apparently my sale has been cancelled as the item is not as described. It is exactly as described and so now I am anxiously awaiting to find out if my bag is being returned to me (in whcih case I will breathe a sigh of relief) - or - as had not even occured to me during the sale, as they now offer direct shipping, goodness knows what the buyer is going to send back to me. Another review on here suggests that they can damage or swap the item and return! SELLERS BEWARE - I would insist on going via their authentification at least so there is no risk via direct shipping. I hope to goodness I get my item back or I will be taking VC to small claims court!

After my last two reviews about refusal of an item that has previously been listed and of course no actions taken from the side, despite their promises (not that actions were expected having in mind their totally disgusting performance), last night i tried to list another item, a jumper from the cruise 2019 collection, brand new with tags. I submitted the listing at 10 pm last night and early this morning the listing , after \u201ccareful examination \u201c of their \u201cexpert\u201d team has been refused. As if their \u201cexpert \u201c team is working during the night to review listings. Ridiculous!!! Also - brand new item with a tag and they refuse it? Maybe this is the new policy of VC, which is not even going to be surprising - they obviously do not accept brand new items anymore as they are surely going down the lane of listing obvious fakes and selling them fast to generate bigger turnover. Moreover, i checked that several same items from same collection are listed there at even much higher price. Anyway. It only reconfirms how totally out of touch with reality this company.
