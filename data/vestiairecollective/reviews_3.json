If you have an issue there is no human available to speak with, no telephone #. You have only 2 options one of which is \"live\" chat., which is really not live but rather some robotic response based on your key issue but not really dealing  with specifics. You can also send an email and hope that someone responds within 24hours. I sold a purse early this month and have been waiting for the payout for several weeks now. No one can explain why I have not been paid (it was supposed to be sent 11 or 12 April) . Their response is that they will forward my inquiry to the relevant department (and wait another 24hrs)! It should be easy for them to determine whether or not there has been a payout on this sale...yes or no! Why must I wait weeks for this to be resolved.

They seem to make it so difficult to speak to anyone. \n\nI am unsure whether the advisors are even trained to help because they seem oblivious and only really share prewritten auto messages and then they will say that they'll email you, and they do, but it takes days to hear anything. From my experience when they do finally get in touch via email, you go around in circles trying to explain what the issue is because they seem confused and oblivious. It's easy to get hooked because it looks like there are lots of great things to buy in one place, but compared to an app like eBay (whose customer service is exceptional) this is really really scraping the bottom of the barrel. It can become quite frustrating to try and get answers to simple questions as a buyer or seller.

Just the opposite, the downfall is epic. It is not worth the time to keep exposing them as in return automatic answers are received, which do not resolve the problem  in 95 % of the cases. They are either \u201cterribly sorry\u201d, or \u201clooking into the matter\u201d or \u201creserving their rights\u201d (mainly to keep doing their endless scams).

Utterly disgusting.\nAnd yes, vc, i know that you can \u201cdetain your rights\u201d but does this include providing  wrong information and misleading your customers?! Just because you control your platform? I do not think so. Lying is not considered a right, it is considered an offense.
