So far I have predominantly good experience with the VC team.\nThe customer service (German language one) is extremely fast and very helpful.\n\nIt has happened that I purchased some articles that did not meet the condition the seller advertised online but I could always make a complaint with the VC Team and so far I was always given right amd refund for such purchases.\n\nAs a seller it\u2019s a bit of a bugger that the items must be shipped within 7 days regardless if there is a long weekend or bank holiday included. I do love the direct shipping option as it helps reduce shipping costs, packaging and it thus more environmentally friendly.","title":"Still a satisfied Seller but reliability of Authentication Process got worse","stars":3,"location":"DE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-20","author":"iva","text":"I waited for the delivery too long time and wrote couple of reminders","title":"I waited for the delivery too long time\u2026","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-20","author":"danuta","text":"Last time it was really very bad service,the shoes was very bad condition,i am very sad that this hapen by VC,","title":"Last time it was really very bad\u2026","stars":1,"location":"PL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-20","author":"Lavinia ","text":"My purchase went smootly and I\u2019m very happy about my new bag.

This hoodie was a poor quality replica, not only the crocodile shape, font \u2018P\u2019alm Angels and quality were different from the authentic Palm Angels one.  And I found 3 more mismatched area.\n\nI\u2019m now waiting for VC second check.  Hope it will not let their loyal customers disappointed \ud83d\ude14 \n\n\nUpdated on 23 Nov 2020\nI was so surprised that VC had passed the authenticity check in 6 hours and has arranged to send the item to me via DHL.  \n\n20 Nov 2020\nI bought a Palm Angels Hoodies from VC on 17 Nov, Order no 32235032 at HKD1540.89. After a few hour,  I found the bought hoodie pictures have some problems, like poor sewing and shape of the crocodile, the font of the brand name under the crocodile on the hoodie, the tag style.   So I messaged the seller to cancel the trade on the same day, but he replied that the hoodie has sent out already. But he can buy it back.  \n\nThen I contacted VC to cancel the trade and send it back to him, but VC replied that they need to receive the hoodie and check it. I confused that this seller had sold a lot of Palm Angels products on VC and all had passed the authenticity check.  Why VC expert can pass them, they are so fake obviously.   \n\nNOW I hope that VC can make a fair judgement, as the buyer couldn\u2019t see the actual goods before they purchase it , the buyer can only trust VC.  This VC has an authenticity charge to the buyer, they should check the item very carefully before they sent it out!!!  My sister had a bad experience with VC before, she bought a Goyard bag from VC but It has little difference between the actual bag and the posting\u2019s picture after the bag arrived.  She wants to refund but VC said that she can re-post the bag only and she needs to bear the delivery charge and authenticity.\n\nSO I don\u2019t want to waste HK$2xx for the delivery & authenticity.  Please send it back to buyer and DO THE REFUND to me ASAP!\n\n\nLastly, VC still have many suspicious Palm Angels Hoodie post which all come from Italy.  Hope VC can look at them and cancel them.  Honestly, VC claimed that they have authenticity check already, but it\u2019s really waste buyer time! The buyer needs to pay in advance and wait for a 7-10 days for receiving the goods, authenticity check but finally it\u2019s not compliance and wait 5 more days to refund for a obvious fake item.  Hope VC can handle it seriously \ud83d\ude10","title":"FAKE palm angels hoodie","stars":2,"location":"HK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-21","author":"AA","text":"If you want to loose your designer items and not to receive your money- welcome to Vestiaire Collective!
