I made 2 orders with 2 different prepaid Visa gift cards and the payment went through just fine. But then when I tried to make more orders after that, using different prepaid gift cards, I attempted to buy each order multiple times.

On my end it would say the item has been sold to me and on the sellers end it would say it\u2019s sold. Each time I tried to contact support to ask why it wouldn\u2019t go through they would say \u201cthe payment didn\u2019t go through because we detected a security issue and you\u2019ll need to talk to your bank to approve the purchase\u201d. I told them \u201cit\u2019s a gift card it\u2019s not linked with any bank\u201d, and they tell me \u201cif that\u2019s the case then try repurchasing it\/ redownload the app\u201d. I did that and it still didn\u2019t work, I tell them and the team tells me to just use a different payment method. Very frustrating for them to not even attempt to try fixing their system if my cards went through beforehand.

Now VC have taken the bag back and not refunding me.\n\nUPDATE:\nIt\u2019s now been 2 weeks since I returned the counterfeit bag, 12 days since it arrived at Vestiaire Collective.  I\u2019ve heard nothing despite their website saying it\u2019ll take 5days, and chatting with customer services chase it for me and then just respond saying there has been a delay. \n\nORIGINAL: \nI purchased a Fendi handbag and paid the extra for authentication. The handbag passed authentication and was posted into me. Within seconds of opening the box I was suspicious that the item was a counterfeit, the quality was just not what I\u2019d expect from a \u00a31000+ handbag. The stitching is off in areas, the branding was low quality, and I\u2019m not convinced the leather was real. My suspicions were confirmed the moment I checked for the RFID tag (which is in all modern Fendi bags). The \u2018RFID\u2019 label inside the bag didn\u2019t actually have an RFID chip in it. Along with the fact the other labels has didn\u2019t match that of an authentic Fendi this confirmed it was a counterfeit. \n\nI contacted Vestiaire Collective straight away showing images and my concerns. Expecting an apology and to return the bag for a refund. But instead I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ve got 7 days (4 of which are bank holidays in the U.K.) to send the item back to France to be re-authenticated, by the same team who couldn\u2019t even spot it was counterfeit in the first place. \n\nNot only am I shocked that I was charged \u00a320 for substandard authentication\u2014 the missing RFID is such a basic check that should have been done.
