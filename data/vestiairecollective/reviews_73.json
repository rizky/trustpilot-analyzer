If you are buying from the Uk just be aware that Vestiaire use Chronopost as their courier company who  have chronic reviews. I have moved address too, a few days ago, and neither Vestiaire or the courier company are helpful with updating my account.  Very frustrating and I really won\u2019t be buying from them again !\nUpdate on day 19....

As a buyer, they do nothing to hold bad, dishonest sellers accountable. Both myself and a friend had orders cancelled by the seller due to them being unsatisfied with the ending price (that they set in the first place) and two different representatives stated it was within terms of service. This allows the seller to keep their listed and sold items at their sold price on their page leaving buyers to think they have a deal. VC has not taken off the \"Trusted Seller\" badge (which is dirt easy to obtain in the first place) nor do they allow buyers to leave reviews. They also pre-screen comments left on buyers pages\/items so there is no way to warn other potential buyers. Seller in particular (@alex125.) Their \"compensation\" was a $10 off credit. POS site.
