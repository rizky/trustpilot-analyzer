I have sold and bought many items with them over the years, but the quality of the service is ramdon. Many people have reported buying items from them and, when they tried to resell them, they were classified as replicas. It happened to me, once I tried to sell a Balenciaga jacked with them, which a friend had bough there. They refused the jacket and said it was not authentic. I was shocked that my friend had done this to me, innocently believing on them. So, I sold the jacket very cheap to a friend, as I thought it was a replica. My friend went on and listed it on VC herself, sold the jacket there, it went through the certification process and declared authentic. I lost then my beloved jacked and thousands of pounds because of them!! Another time, all my items were being refused and I thought it was strange, as I knew they were genuine. I contacted the customer service and they told me that there was a problem with my photos, as they were too professional, like professional brands. Thus, they thought that I had stollen them online. This looks like a prank! I have good photos because I am a professional and have good equipment. Anyone that knows about photography, knows how to check the photos and verify if they were stolen online or not, as photos came with settings, which professionals know how to authenticate. If they do not know how to do the job, how come that offer that service?! More recently, I had another experience even worse. Last summer I sold a Gucci clutch on their website, item 11173740. The bag went through the authetication process, declared genuine, but there was a small fault, as the clutch smelled to perfume. They proposed to reduce the price of the item and send if to the buyer. I refused the proposal, as I prefered to have it back. They clutch was returned and later on I listed it again. The same item was sold on VC, item 11719601, some weeks ago. But, guess what, this time considered non-authentic. The same item!! I contacted them by chat and was told that it was difficult to authenticate that item; they were unsure, so, they had refused it. Firtsly, I would like to know how come that the same item was accepted once as authentic and second time as non-authentic. Secondly, if they would be unable to authenticate an item, why not be honest and tell that both to the seller and buyer. I may understand that they would not sell it. But, if they do not know if it is authentic or not, then, they cannot also classify it as replica. I no longer have the receipts of course, as the clutch was offered many years ago. But, as a consequence of their lack of knowledge and unfair policy, I lost my expert seller status. I have sold 170 items with VC througout the years and only had one problem once!!","title":"Same item declared as genuine and later on replica","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=80&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-01-11","author":"E E","text":"I don't know any other platform to buy and sell preloved items with authentication and ships to my country so VC was my only option. \n\nI recently purchased a Dior Book Tote labelled 'very good condition' and seller noted no defects. Upon receiving, I found an orange stain on the bag which was not stated in the description and obviously missed by VC! They sent me a very generic response stating they are sorry and they will do their best as not to let it happen again. \n\nAbout 3 weeks prior, my cousin ordered a Gucci Marmont bag which was \"brand new\" and listed the condition as great. When she received it, she found three dents + creases on the bag which were OBVIOUS. When she brought it up, VC basically copy and pasted the same response of being sorry and ensuring it will never happen again. \n\nI sent a screenshot of the email of the response my cousin received to them to say that they let the same problem happen again, and to me. After that they apologised to state that I can send the bag for cleaning and they \"might\" refund me the cleaning fee. I said that I needed a guarantee for this cleaning fee and a \"might\" would not suffice. Again, they apologised to say that they can't confirm it..... what a sloppy company. How is it that they missed so many defects? And refuse to do anything about it. It's evidently their faults for overlooking defects\n\nOn a less important note: the seller told me that the Dior Book Tote came with the dustbag. When I received it, it had the VC dustbag instead which I was sooo disappointed with. Maybe it's my fault for not making sure but I also think the seller should've been more transparent stating that it wouldn't be the original dustbag and VC should have also confirmed with me if I was okay with it being a non-Dior dustbag","title":"VC missed sooo many defects","stars":1,"location":"MY","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=80&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-01-11","author":"Lucy","text":"I had previously bought a bag from them and the process was very smooth without any problems. I bought another item from them and had to relist it since they don't accept return and the process was fine except they took commissions out of the sale when they claimed they wouldn't for relisted items. \n\nThe real problem happened after I purchased a Dior clutch through direct shipping and the purse looked very different from the pictures. So I raised a dispute to return the order to get a refund. The following two weeks became hell ... I went back and forth talking to their support agents through in-app chat service to get a coherent answer on how the refund process works. One agent told me to send to the seller directly whilst another told me to send it to their France hub because of Brexit! Brexit?! I was sent two emails from VC telling me two different timelines of handing the refund and when i reached out to them again they changed the story one more time. \n\nNow I don't have the purse nor the money - same goes for the seller. Their online agents seem to be trained to make up stories so that you can get a satisfactory answer so that you can give them good reviews and leave them alone. But things never happened as they had promised in their chats ...\n\nI have now raised a dispute with PayPal knowing they will never give me a satisfactory answer.

Since the buyer wanted the jacket so badly I accepted it begrudgingly. \n\nAnd for the record, I\u2019m not one of those sellers that fake about an item that\u2019s worn as not worn.
