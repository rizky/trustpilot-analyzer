I initially ordered it on the 2nd of March and the seller sent it in a day late, which automatically cancelled the order. I was still interested so after the item was finally re-listed (customer support sent me multiple faulty links before I was able to see it listed again), I bought the item again on the 31st of March.\n\nSince then, I've contacted customer support several times to receive an update on my order, as it's not progressed since ordering it again at the end of March. Most conversations via chat were deferred to email but then never followed up on. I've never experienced such terrible service and there's no one to speak to to resolve it.\n\nThe seller has also confirmed over the Vestiaire chat that they sent the item in and the item is held at a Vestiaire Warehouse and that they are also not receiving any updates on its whereabouts almost 4 weeks later.","title":"Order nightmare","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=4&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-23","author":"Weronika Oszajca","text":"Unfortunately, I am forced to add this rating, despite the fact that I have been selling regularly on Vestiaire Collective since 2020, I have several hundred transactions behind me and I am satisfied with the vast majority of them. Despite the described situation, I still use this app and I generally like it, but this situation is bothering me, so I go as far as possible to finally solve it. I hope this is some kind of misunderstanding. Unfortunately, there has been a certain situation in which I am forced to react in this way, because despite numerous e-mails sent to Vestiaire Collective, I have not received a reply to any of them. In January, I sold two vintage Dior tops that I believe were genuine. However, people verifying their authenticity found that they were not able to confirm it, which I understand and wanted my items back. For this purpose, I made two transfers for the amount of EUR 12, with the reference numbers of these items in the title. The transfers were made on February 12, until today I have not received parcels with the return of my items. These were items worth a total of $ 473 (this is the amount I was supposed to get for the items sold). Since then, I have sent several e-mails to VC by Send a request, from my own experience I know that in case of more serious problems it is better to contact VC directly via the e-mail address. I wanted to know what was happening with these shipments, but received no reply and my belongings never returned to me. I am very sad and disappointed with this behavior, especially with regard to the regular user of the portal. I hope that thanks to this post someone will pay attention to my problem and it will be solved, the amount I mention is significant for me and I would like to get this money or my items back.","title":"Never received my items back","stars":1,"location":"PL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=4&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-23","author":" Viki Jones","text":"I ordered a designer item which never arrived.\n\nThe tracking was stuck on \"sent to Vestiaire\" so after two weeks I contacted Vestiaire via webchat. They said they will need to open an investigation which will take a further 15 - 30 days. They then said I have to write a handwritten statement confirming that I, my neighbours or any member of my family have received the item. I then have to give all my details, a copy of my ID and an invoice.\n\nI don't see why I have to do all this when Vestiaire lost my item!! I want a refund or the item sending. I asked the webchat if somebody would call me and the person on the other end \"Jack\" said he would. I gave him my number. He asked could he help me with anything else, so I said yes, ring me.
