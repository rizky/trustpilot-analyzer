Eventually a real person does join the chat but does not understand that I\u2019m asking for a refund and instead tells me to submit my bank information for payments as if I was a seller. \n\nI bought my item 3 weeks ago, and I have no item and no refund, still. \n\nThe level of unprofessionalism and incompetence from this company is staggering.

I am just hoping that by sharing experiences- unfortunately negative - I can help other users not be scammed as well.\nAnd as it is an EU company finally some measures will be taken against their continuous malpractices , that thankfully can be easily proven. Throughout  the years i have had some negative experiences with them, shared some of them and read a lot of \u201chorror\u201d stories from other users (things that should not be happening in 21st. Century in europe) . I was thinking - OMG, thanks God  things did not get that bad with me. The truth is that sooner or later their plague catches you. Now i can say that i have experienced every single ridiculousness that this company has to offer. From misplaced items, items showing not shipped on time despite of being shipped completely on time, perfect high fashion items being rejected to list (while at the same time some users are selling Birkins at 500 eur each and direct shipping, and these same users are granted expert sellers badges, what a joke; numerous comments from users and not a sign from VC taking care of the issue), games with the status bars, games with the badges - illogically given or taken, differnece in announced commissions, differences in amounts that have to be paid and are actually paid, countless attempts to actually have a conversation with bots, numerous attempts to get resolutions turning to the so called Customer service, not being paid, not  getting refunds. Tons of wasted time and money lost. Mistakes after mistakes. Nobody is perfect but in my case every single mistake was done by them. Which actually makes me super mad. Because i am ready to pay for my own mistakes if any but not ready to be mistreated and take losses for mistakes\u2019s of others. The worst is that none of those mistakes have been fixed. Always in business something unexpected can happen. Important thing is to handle it and fix it. Unfortunately the pattern of VC is just the opposite- they just never own up to their own wrong-doings or handle them. Almost looks that all this is done intentionally, like an internal company policy or something. They just ignore and make fun of you.  And the more they mess up, the more they deflect. And this is totally degrading. One cannot feel safe selling or buying because the whole process simply depends on the current mood of some unskilled employee, the possibility of an \u201cunfixable\u201d glitch in their computer system and total unwillingness and abscence of desire on behalf of the CS to take care of a wrongful situation. Which screams only one thing - this is a pattern and they simply do not care. There is no consistency in the whole process, the only sure thing is that sooner or later you will get scammed, and then again and again. These are not isolated incidents. These are repeatable patterns.  They can give as many polite copy\/paste answers here but the truth is that actually nothing is ever handled. They would give their \u201csincere apologies\u201d and declare promises, but in reality problems are not being taken care of. They just deepen. They have been ignored and swiped under the carpet. And VC relies on the fact that being the biggest platform for such services in Europe people will turn a blind eye and will keep doing business with them. And i have done the same in the past, so many times. But by doing this, I realized that i was only helping them develop that endless spiderwebs of lies and scams masked behind that brilliant idea of creating and maintaining such a platform. The idea is genious, i totally admire it. The execution - super close to zero. More and more people are sharing negative repeatable experience and this should be raising red flags. If that was the feedback i was getting for my own company, despite the profits rocketing, i would be slapping my face and rolling my sleeves to really dig deep and fine the roots of all Problems and fix them. But this is only if you care about your customers. Otherwise - you just remain tone deaf and keep piling up your profits. Well, it is what it is. I only know that no scam can continue forever, i just hope\nIn the meantime not too many people get hurt by this notorious company.\nUpdate to the latest reply: VC please stop! I know how the system works, obviously. I have sold more than 420 items. What are you exactly explaing? This inadequate answer below shows only that you do not even read the comments which explain the exact issues. Looks like your bots just randomly pick and use one of your templates for answers and publishes it. Just to imitate some concern and activity.Really very low from your side. You do not fix issues and you do not want to be aware of them.
