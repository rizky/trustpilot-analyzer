However, my birthday this year my partner purchased a pair of Valentino rockstuds as a gift. He paid for authentication but as soon as they arrived it was clear something was wrong. First off, the condition was not \u2018very good\u2019 as listed, but the shoes also had a terrible chemical odor. We immediately went online and found this was a sign of a fake item. Many other signs were also present including and incorrectly formatted authentication code in shoe and generally shoddy make. We told Vestiaire this but they assured us the item was genuine. So we took the item to a Valentino store, where we were told these things would not be expected on a genuine item. Vestiaire then allowed us to resubmit the shoes for authentication at their cost. We did, and they agreed with us and processed a refund. Three days later I received a notification from the Vestiaire app that the shoes were \u2018back in stock\u2019 and could be purchased directly from vestiare with free authentication. I reported via live chat that this must be a mistake, but had it confirmed to me that whilst this was the same pair of shoes, they had now passed authentication again. I made the assistant on the chat aware of the situation, but nothing is being done apart from a report being raised which will take at least 3 days to be addressed while the shoes remain on sale. This gives serious concern about Vestiaires authentication process as well the items that are already in their possession and pre-authenticated- how many of these have been returned due to inauthenticity? It is one thing to make a mistake and authenticate a fake, but to knowingly relist this fake item themselves as a pre-authenticated item and leave them for sale is fraudulent.","title":"WHAT WENT WRONG?

I sell more than I buy, whilst as a buyer it's been satisfactory so far fortunately, selling with them is another story.

All of them authentic items in highly sellable condition-- Had there been some change with the selection criteria? Their chat bot\/human's response was simply because 'they could not confirm the authenticity', even if you upload giant close ups of the serial numbers, authenticity cards etc apparently it doesn't matter, and these are all big name brands which you would've thought these 'experts' would be able to determine a real from a fake. These guys had the nerve to come back to me after 72 hours (which is well over the 48 hour time span they promised) serially rejecting listings like they can't be bothered to look at it. After some pushback the chat guy finally ask the team to have a second look, and guess back, they've managed to accept SOME of the items & even slapped on a 'We Love' sticker?? How do you go from claiming that the listing doesn't look authentic to honoring an item as something 'We Love'? I'm currently waiting for them to have a 'second look' on the Saint Laurent bag which had a close up of the tag and barcode, but this is VC inconsistency at its finest, and to be honest I wouldn't even think about buying anything worth more than 100 EUROS on this platform given the level of incompetence of these so called 'experts'.
