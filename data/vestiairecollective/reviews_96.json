I checked online on their terms and conditions that I was allowed to cancel the sale by law, as their terms and conditions do not stop me from doing so. Althought this is a very silly mistake, and of course it is my own fault, which I entirely assume, I can request this, so, they would need to process it by law. Nevertheless, when I contacted VC, I was told that technically it was not possible, as the item was already on their warehouse, so technically was not mine. But, in reality, I was not paid and the item had not been shipped to the buyer anyway. How come that they create a system that they cannot fulfil themselves. It was indeed my fault, but if the system allows me to cancel the sale, for sure, they need to allow that to happen. Otherwise, the system is unreliable and I can sue them and seek compensation. It seems that the whole process is very automatic and they have no control over it.","title":"I sold an item at VC 11555535 and\u2026","stars":1,"location":"BE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=96&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-19","author":"Charlotte","text":"The worst customer service that I\u2019ve ever experienced in my life. 100% do not recommend buying from them.","title":"The worst customer service that I\u2019ve\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=96&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-19","author":"Flora kwan","text":"Bad service, process case super slow \nmy bag bought from UK, VS team no ask me give proof of information then said unable to verify authentic.\nOk, I paid delivery fee for my bag return, I gave proof of payment to VS team, but no one updates my bag, only say payment team will check and shipping within 14 days, model answer, no one to check, super bad service!

Their customer service team is terrible at communicating and they said all they could do was offer me this 'code' for free shipping and let the warehouse know to be more vigilant.

After leaving this review, VC did act in a way I'd hav expected and actually refunded the \u00a320. I also used the free shipping on my next order. I've now made three purchases and all the items have been as described and delivered from France very quickly.\n\n**Avoid** I've been considering a VC purchase for years and finally bought something yesterday. Before checking out I was offered \u00a320 off my first purchase over \u00a3150. This misleading offer stated no terms so I assumed all would be fine. I'd spent an hour finding another item (to make up the total to \u00a3150). On checking out, the code was accepted but did nothing. The chat bot directed me to continue through the various checkout procedures and my discount would be taken at the end. Instead, this completed my transaction without a 'confirm your order' page, so my money was taken.\n\nOn complaining about all this faff and paying more than expected, the chat (real people) were useless; first accusing me of trying to use the code on my second order when in fact I'd never ordered before - then suggesting I must be in another country than the UK (I'm in the UK).\n\nOn further complaining by email, it transpires that for the code to work, the purchase price must be for a single item. I've been offered free shipping on my next order. NO THANK YOU! I won't be placing a 'next order'.\n\n-- edit -- \n\nFurther to my previous edit, the sunglasses I purchased have had to be refunded because the seller has said they are no longer for sale.

J.","text":"This is the second (NEGATIVE) review I have written about Vestiaire Colletive. A year ago, I wrote about my first experience on this platform. A bag was advertised, I contacted the seller, I was sent a price-offer and I bought it. After payment was processed, my purchase was confirmed. Shortly afterwards, I received an email claiming that the item was no longer available and my money would be refunded. Pathetic. And dubious. Recently I decided to try a second time. I purchased earrings which the seller would be send directly to me. My Paypal payment went through but no email confirmation arrived from VC. After a week, I contacted Customer Service. I was told that my purchase had gone though. Why didn\u2019t I receive an email about this in the first place? I then wrote back requesting information on when I could expect delivery of my purchase, as the seller had not been in contact, despite me sending her a message via the VC website. Now I have received an email claiming that the purchase will be cancelled because the goods were not delivered within the mandatory 14 days since purchase (still actually have 2 days to go). So my guess is the earrings have long been unavailable for whatever reason or the seller-profile was fake. This company is incapable of running a transparent, honest business. Either the items are suddenly not available after purchase or the seller can\u2019t be contacted and never sends the goods. All of you who have had satisfactory experience with VC, I\u2018m really happy for you. But I for one will never have anything to do with VC again.","title":"Second NEGATIVE experience with VC","stars":1,"location":"DE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=96&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-22","author":"Katie","text":"I've been a member for ages, and unfortunately felt compelled to tell other potential customers not to get their hopes up. Over the last year I've had six (6!) consecutive orders cancelled after the sale went through \u2013 a few times after weeks of waiting and hundreds (sometimes 1000s) of $ being transferred. It is refunded of course, but after waiting, expecting for weeks and weeks, and then suddenly the item is 'not available'. There seems to be no accountability or trust system to actually follow through on a sale. No way to leave a review of the seller or contact them, either. After these multiple bad experiences, I wonder how many of these items are actually for sale, or whether there is something else going on. It's like shopping at an imaginary store. Quite a big waste of time, in my opinion better spent on other sites where you actually receive what you bought! :)","title":"Muliple cancelled sales; no accountability","stars":1,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=96&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-23","author":"Mimizan","text":"Order number 11413847. \n\nDon\u2019t ask me to email you guys.
