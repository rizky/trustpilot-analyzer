For 7 days nothing happened, the seller ghosted me and then on day 7 I was informed the item was 'no longer available'. Beware, basically a seller can pull out up to 7 days after you have bought an item and just cancel without any apology or consequence. \n\nFinally, to add insult to injury, I received an email stating I would receive a refund for the list price but excluding the shipping and administration costs. Allegedly I will receive a second email (at a later date) for the refund of shipping and admin costs, but frankly I do not trust this.\n\nHorrible experience all round. Did not receive the item and have yet to receive a refund. Customer service was far worse than Ebay, which is very disappointing given their positioning as a luxury reseller platform.

VC gave me multiple excuses, and the shoe I bargained down was given to someone else. Despite me purchasing first and VC confirming an issue on their end, the shoes were gone!\n\nAntagonised me by sending me tracking updates regarding the order they cancelled. I should've gone back to Ebay at this very moment. \n\nPurchase number 2:\nDior trainers, the sole cannot be cleaned on this particular style, and it's tough to get marks off as its a delicate fabric\n\nThey authenticated the first pair I ordered. I have pairs already of this shoe; I wanted to ensure it was a legit site.\nThe shoe came filthy! Poor condition, although stated as good. The shoe size wasn't for me; they had been worn so much clearly by a wide foot. So I have to resell. \nThe second shoe was perfect. just as described in good condition, much like the pairs I have ( these come in various colours) \n\nThe most recent pair (3) is horrible! The shoe has the fabric colouring on the sole, bleach marks and meaning this cannot be removed. The seller advertised them as gently worn and had no clear pictures of the soles.\nUpon receiving the shoe - I made a claim\/report instantly.\n\nI contacted them the next day due to no acknowledgement of the first report. \n\nWhen speaking with an advisor called Reyanne B - she said my report wasn't received and I have to make another one, which I did with her on the chat,\nShe confirmed receipt and said that I'd get an email regarding this inconvenience as soon as.\n\nStill nothing. \nI contact again as the window is closing to make a report. The lady named Cathyrine M says I should make yet another report because they didn't receive it; I'm exhausted with the horrible customer service that this company proved.\nI made it clear I wouldn't be making any more reports as I have made enough- If this isn't rectified and they note that this shoe style cannot be cleaned, they need to mark all as fair and price accordingly.\n\nI will contact my bank as a last resort if this isn't sorted out; I'm tired and worn thin with them.\nI've never been so stressed talking to people who don't care about the customers! \n\nYou can't expect people to be out of pocket with items that aren't wearable.

This is \nIncluding premium brands which they fail to recognise.\nBut worst thing is so so many fake offers - which means you can't accept other perhaps genuine offers until nearly two days are up for the fake offer to be invalidated!!! By that stage the othe purchasers have lost interest.\nSometimes multiple fake offers are made  from the same site but the only recourse is their fairly useless WhatsApp customer service area which takes ages and says it'll take action but nothing seems to happen. The spurious buyers just keep on bidding and takes some time to realise they're fantasists...\nAlso if you spot a small mistake on their international sizing system - ie you list something in one country's size and it appears wrong on another market's size - you can't seem to revise this but have to go through the interminable customer service chat - if they actually answer -  where many of the operators just don't seem to understand what you're trying to explain. Can take half an afternoon so not worth the trouble.\nI speak French so have been able to reply to some potential purchasers queries in French person.\nHowever the main problem is that  some of these so called buyers are more like time wasters and never banned.\nAfter reply from Vestiare...\n\nBtw have just had a very nice reply from Vestiare - below - but illustrates how  customer service doesn't keep tabs on what the app uploading system is saying.\nThey claim they list brands like Michael Michael Kors but I've literally just grabbed another screenshot of their site saying they no longer take orders from Michael Michael Kors!
