It is nice to read an answer that is longer than 3 sentences, which is what I had received so far when contacting you via your \u201cHelp\u201d or \u201cHow-to-contact-Vestiaire-Collective\u201d, which is also why I have no intention to use those options, so no need to send these links again in future answer. \n\nI also feel that answering you here is far more helpful to other VC users. \n\nAs written in my first review here below and as communicated with your \u201csupport\u201d several times: the sale was canceled due to your mistake without even contacting the carrier nor myself. When I contact you (via your \u201csupport\u201d), I provided with a proof that UPS and myself shipped the item on time. Moreover, the buyer did not cancel the sale but you did. She wrote me in a comment that she contact you because she didn\u2019t understand why the sale was canceled. Strangely enough, you deleted these comments after the second time I contact your \u201csupport\u201d. \n\nAfter the third chat with your \u201csupport\u201d my item was sent back to me without any consulting nor mentioning the buyer. On the App however it is still \u201cin progress \u2014 item assessment\u201d. Strangely#2. \n\n\nI\u2019m still waiting to your solution on this lost sale.

I would strongly recommend not to trust your items with this company.\n\nI sold a new Valentino belt. Never worn, with tags and box. Most likely the lady who bought it was intrigued by the price and the condition that she didn't check the size. Long story short she didn't fit in the belt, tried to close the buckle and damaged the belt. She then claimed that the belt was already damaged which it was 100% lies since I never worn the belt as it was huge on me. \n\nI have the belt pictures of the before I sent it and how the belt looks now and she totally destroyed it. \n\nVestiaire don't even want to get involved, on the contrary they are so lazy that they said from the pictures she said the belt is obviously damaged due to wear and tear which is crazy that they come to this conclusion since they were the once approving the uploads in the first place (and they check the photos).\n\nSeriously it's better to go in physical stores to re-sell your good rather than trust this company. \n\nNow i have an item that I can easily throw out from the damage and I lost 200\u00a3 all because of Vestiaire.\n\nDon't trust them","title":"Do not sell your items on Vestiaire","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=47&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-09-01","author":"Mel","text":"DO NOT SELL ON THIS PLATFORM!

I asked to cancel the order because with shipping, customs and authentication fees it was actually cheaper to buy the item brand new. I was then told that it can only be cancelled by the seller, so I needed to ask them (seller is actually penalised in this case - even though it was VCs fault).

But before that for about 2 months they were saying that the item is been with their experts , who,according to them were verifying the authenticity.......... I never got my money or my shoes back  ( they were worth 725 euro ) and girl from US never got the shoes .                                   2) Any time I try to place an add for my handbags , they ask for new photos . I take very good photos with my Samsung,  never blurred etc. And I sent always at least 12 of them with all possible details . But same story again and again . Very strange that there are items ( like Hermes bags ) with only one photo or very few and not clear .....And that is ok  . ... I wonder how they decide that ?? It makes zero sens ....                                   3) Impossible to contact them . NO PHONE NUMBER to call to them , they say: coz of Covid restrictions  hahaha  I never heard such an absurd ......So there is option of chat with computer,  machine , asking few same questions , before a human join . But if you leave the chat for a while , there is no chance you get back to same person . Same questions are asked by machine before a human join but different than  you already spoke to . So guess ..what ....extra  10 or more minutes wate of your time . Another way of communicating with them is : the machine is asking you for your email adress and once you answer ,the chat is finished haha . Then you go to your mailbox and guess what ....there is something called \" noreply email\" haha . Amazing experience... defo for people with very strong nervs ....So if you want to complain about terrible servive of theirs you can not !!!!                                4) \" Premium member \" , another \"awesome \"trick of VC . So I payed for premium,  thought would give me some extra possibilities.  But any time there is an item in super good price is already reserved by another \" premium member \" . And owners do not like the system either as their items are reserved for hours and people who really would buy it straigh away can not .... Very frustrating .. .. .                                                   5) I really do not understand how VC can cooperate with Mytheresa ( and seems like it does) as Mytheresa is real awesome experience any time I use it and I use it a lot and very regurally .. ..So it all seems to be big mystery .. how such terrible website still exsists .
