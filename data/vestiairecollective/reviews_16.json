There was one time, Vestiare themselves were selling a cartier bracelet at a good price, of couse there are a lot people interested and left comments. i am very interested and after seeing the other comments regarding the odd shape of the bracelet i decided to ask as i really want it and wants to make sure, it is selling for 6500 pounds and it is a lot of money. i asked them privately about authenticity and why the bracelet has an odd shape, was it damaged etc\uff0c instead of getting any reply, i see all comments with these doubts have been deleted within a hour, further more my private chat has been banned, without a notification, without any emails. i tried to reach out to their customer service and asking this unfair ban for my private chat everytime they copied their chat policy. i told them i am fully aware the policy: do,not offer deals outside of platform which i certainly wont do as a buyer, do not use bad language which i never do, all polite conversations about the items i want to buy. Please be aware i am a buyer, i  will need to clear my doubts before place an order. For the first few times, i can physically talk to a human, who said they will definitely look into this and have this sorted with no time, i still kept these emails, however after a few times, no reply and my private chat is still banned. The last email i have received with a very bad attitude just copied the chat policy in email and tell me my private chat is banned permenantly, again without explaination, no reason. Now i can no longer contact with customer service because i am talking to a robot and never pass my message on. Nobody will resolve my issue even when it is done unfairly. As i buyer i have rights to ask authenticity and related question. Please bear in mind guys, i was banned straight away after chat with Vestiare selling department. How snobbish and how unprofessional they are! My ID is cong1425185, i have spent 14000 pounds on the platform and thats how they treat me. This is a genuine review, i feel so frustrated and hurt the way they treat their genuine customers who pays promotely, never complaint about my orders even sometime i am not 100 percent happy, i still decide to deal with it myself rather than return. For example the first purchase of a miu miu bag, it was stated very good condition but i have received a badly worn bag, not even a fair condition. i just sold on ebay by bidding auction myself and lost 250pounds instantly. i am a literally hussle free customer, thats what i get -- to be banned from doing nothing wrong at all. I am very very disappointed, will not spend my money anymore.","title":"I am a buyer","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=16&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-17","author":"Manahan Family","text":"Literally duped me with a fault item, I returned it to get a refund - and since then, I've had no refund and no one is helping.

The initially blew me off, but then when I sent screenshots of the tracking status on the FedEx website I was asked to log in and update my delivery address. When the package still didn't move, I contacted FedEx directly and the informed me the address was incorrect but only the shipper could make a change. Went back to VC, informed them of the update. Still nothing. They kept sending me emails asking me to prove I hadn't received the package so they could open an investigation. I then contacted FedEx to see if they could return the item to the shipper so they can update the address and reship it. Guess what happened: the package was shipped to the US, sent out for delivery, and then returned because it could not be delivered. I reached back out to VC again to inform them of the issue, they confirmed by email that I would receive a refund as soon as the package is received back at their facility. Then a new issue arise. Package has been held at the FedEx facility in France pending clearing by the shipper. I've reached out to VC several times since this update. They initially assured me that I would receive a refund as soon as they get the package back, but then they went back to requesting that I prove I did not receive the package  (handwritten letter, ID, the works) and THEN they would open an investigation into a package that is clearly being held at a shipping facility.

First order placed for a pair of Saint Laurent boots, these were used but the photos on the website showed the boots as being in great condition and described by the seller as 'very good condition'.  When the boots arrived they were in dreadful condition and it was obvious the seller has listed them for sale and continued to wear them after listing them and when the boots finally sold on Vestiaire the condition was nothing like the pictures or the desciption posted, the boots were in a disgusting condition, filthy dirty and covered in scratches and creases.  Vestiaire dealt with this situation quickly and issued a shipping label for the boots to be returned to the seller.\n\nI decided not to take the risk again and ordered a brand new pair of Saint Laurent boots from Vestiaire - order number 52216928 for \u00a3455.  The boots arrived yesterday and I immediately tried them on.  When I put the boot on my right foot I screamed out in pain and had to gently ease my foot out of the boot as there was something in the front section of the boot that had cut my foot.  I put my hand into the boot and something then stuck into my finger under my nail.  When I looked into the boot there was a large two pronged staple stuck up through the sole of the boot into the cavity where your foot sits.  The staple was at least 1\/2 a cm long.  I tried to get my hand into the front section of the boot to pull the staple out but as the boots are pretty slim at the front there was absolutely no way of getting a grip of the staple without damaging the boot. The staple is stuck solid in the front of the boot and I believe the only way to remove it is to take it to a shoe repair shop and have the sole of the boot removed to take the staple out.  I have managed to get photos of the staple inside the boot.  I contacted the seller on their sales page and she replied stating \"I tried these boots on and there was no any staples inside or any other problem\", her wording. Wow this person must have teflon feet because my whole family have now viewed and felt the piece of metal inside the front of this boot!\n\nBecause this was a direct sale I reported the problem to Vestiaire and sent them pictures of the staple sticking up inside the front of the boot.  I asked them for a partial refund in order for me to take the brand new pair of boots to a shoe repair shop and have the staple removed in order for me to be able to wear the boots. Their response is both shocking and unacceptable.  They responded as follows:\n\n'I am so sorry that you receive an item that doesn't match the sellers description.  Since the sold process of your item is Direct Shipping we cannot give you any compensation or partial refund.\n\nWe can only offer you two options:\n\n1. Relist the item without commission and receive the proceeds of the sale.\n\n2. Return the item for a full refund.'\n\nI cannot believe that Vestiaire have sent a message stating they are willing to relist such a dangerous item that has already cause injury to me.  Why would I relist an item and let someone else go through what I have experienced.  These boots were supposed to be brand new, they are clearly a faulty pair of boots the seller is selling on Vestiaire's website to unsuspecting buyers. If I buy a brand new pair of boots I expect to be able to wear them and not have to spend more money getting them repaired in order to wear them.\n\nI have now asked Vestiaire to send a returns label in order to return the boots to the seller but so far I have heard nothing further from them.\n\nThe fact that Vestiaire or the seller are taking no responsibility for the condition of these brand new boots and the fact that I have been injured just by trying them on is totally unacceptable and wrong on every level.  The pictures taken are clear evidence of the condition of these boots. \n\nPlease be aware when using this website that what is on a sellers listing pictures and contained in the description is not always an accurate portrayal of the condition of the item you will receive!\n\nI live in the UK - Standard shipping as you suggest for an item located in the UK means sending it to France for verification.  It will then be sent from France to the UK and incur import duties!  Why would anyone located in the UK purchasing an item located in the UK want to incur unnecessary import duties??
