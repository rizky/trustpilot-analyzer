They now seemed to have lost my latest order, Leather chanel espadrilles under reference 21321705. The customer service is terrible, you can't speak to anyone other then this computerised website. If you read a lot of reviews from both customers and sellers this is the main complaint that there is no real help from customer service if you have a problem. When I asked customer service where my order was he initially tried to say I'd received it on the 4th March but luckily I have email confirmation to say they had received my order on the 4th March at their hub for authentication. It is now the 10th March and I'm still not getting an answer as to where my order has gone. Customer service is so bad you can't really get an answer either. I think when your spending money on high end items there should be a proper customer service team that you can verbally speak to if you have any problems. Everytime I ask if I can speak to someone they ignore my question on the Web chat. I think my latest item has been lost in their hub as I've ordered other items from abroad after my espadrilles that have been authenticated and now sent to me. I think if you have any problems there is no real help which is a very worrying concern. I feel there is a real possibility that if an item gets lost you may never get your item and loose your money. Reading the reviews of people on here there is obviously something very wrong with this company, their are so many complaints about customer service and things being brought but not sent and items going missing, refunds not being given etc etc etc, I really think Trading standards and legal action needs to be considered with this company as what their doing is very wrong both legally and morely, the stress to the customer and seller is so unnecessary if the company new what they we're doing. Surely someone in management should be reading how bad their reviews are and looking into why they have so many complaints, it's all to do with word of mouth and people will stop buying from here unless someone within the company looks into why their is so many problems with items going Missing and people loosing money for items not received.","title":"So I decided to give Vestiaire another\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=12&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-10","author":"ZanW","text":"Purchased a pair of Louboutin shoes on 24\/2.

Sadly (no doubt as a way to cut costs) Vestiaire started using Hermes for all UK shipments under the value of \u00a3200. Hermes are slow at best and incompetent at worst. They have no contact centre that sellers can reach out to as their \u201cdedicated phone line\u201d is for account holders only and Vestiaire are the account holder not the seller. As a result when things go wrong you are reliant on Vestiaire to resolve and anyone that has experienced their customer service team knows how that goes\u2026\n\nI have currently had two parcels (sent at different times) appear to have been undelivered (according to Vestiaire anyway) and tracking now shows each parcel as \u201con it\u2019s way back to sender\u201d when in fact they are not. Instead they appear to be lost. Item reference 21056327 was shipped on 28th February and item reference 17689586 on 4th March. I\u2019ve contacted Vestiaire on so many occasions and they don\u2019t seem capable of doing the most simple action and contacting Hermes (despite the fact Hermes have a \u201cdedicated account holder phone line\u201d). The tracking doesn\u2019t even appear to have got to a delivery stage, it\u2019s like there\u2019s a technical glitch because it goes from being collected from the drop off point to \u201con its way back to sender\u201d. One of these parcels should have gone to Vestiaire for authentication and the other to a buyer directly. No delivery attempts appear to have been made and yet the parcels are coming back?? It makes no sense. Nor can I understand why if they are being returned they haven\u2019t actually come back?! Vestiaire could contact Hermes and no doubt resolve this issue pretty quickly (as gauging from the reviews this has happened to more sellers than myself so might be a more widespread issue) but instead I either get emails asking for identification documentation (which I\u2019ve already provided and they\u2019ve done nothing with) or I get no reply at all. I am one of the highest performing sellers on this platform and yet Vestiaire clearly do not care about retaining business. I\u2019m out of pocket on two items - I don\u2019t have the goods or payment and Vestiaire are not being remotely helpful in finding a resolution. There are no issues with the address details of either parcel (as I said, one was going to Vestiaire\u2019s U.K. hub) so why can\u2019t Vestiaire just liaise with Hermes to ensure the parcels arrive at the destination addresses? It doesn\u2019t feel like rocket science and is simple enough to resolve with companies like DHL and UPS who view the seller\/sender as the client and therefore actually speak to sellers when there\u2019s an issue. If Vestiaire want to save money by using poor courier companies like Hermes then they need to accept that when there\u2019s an issue the onus is on them to do the leg work to resolve.","title":"Please stop using Hermes","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=12&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-11","author":"Tanya Harbas  from Croatia","text":"What kind of a scam are Westiaire working on ?\nI have sold 5 items but got paid for two only .\nHermes and Chanel handbags.\nIn spite of numerous emails and time waisting no payment for 6 weeks !\nReceived a note yesterday verification failed again .\nInformation on my payment account is correct .as two payments confirmed .\nAll this is from 31.1.2022 \u2026..why .\nI receive email from you indicating payment will be 24,26,28 February- no money.\nSecond email 6 .March suggesting payment in seven days \u2026.until last night.
