Vestiaire overcharged their commission on my 7 new listings I posted about 20 days ago, after several emails to CS their technical experts replied & insisted nothing wrong (they keep lying as usual).\n\nI decided to take the matter to the Hong Kong Consumer Council, with HKCC\u2019s involvement Vestiaire CS finally admitted they overcharged me and said their technical experts will have the mistakes corrected.  \nI asked CS how this could happen, do Vestiaire charge commission as much as they want & not following their commission guidelines?\n\nCouple of days have passed, nothing happen\/corrected, I will give them a few more days, will keep you guys updated!   \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\u2014-\nTo BUYER\u2014 I suspect there are internal dealings within Vestiaire.   I bought a very rare jacket at super good price, I was excited & looking forward to receive it.   The seller confirmed to me she had shipped the jacket to V Paris, but it didn\u2019t show in the system, eventually my order was cancelled & I was refunded.    The suspicious thing is the seller told me later she was paid, so who has my extremely rare jacket?  \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u2014\nAnother CASE\nA buyer offered me 48usd for a McQueen pullover, despite I\u2019m happy my 500usd pullover go to a new home I don\u2019t want to pay the 17usd fixed commission.   I explained to the buyer, I would appreciate 51usd so I only need to pay 10% commission  to V instead of the fixed 17 (51-200usd = 10% commission).     I was amazed seeing our chart messages were deleted about 30 seconds later.  \n\nBuyer agreed and bought it at 51, when the pullover arrived V\u2019s HK office their experts informed me they found the length of the pullover was 1cm short from what I described.   They proposed to the buyer a few usd reduction, at the end I was charged 17usd commission \ud83d\ude21\n\nVestiaire used to be good, I have been shopping there since 2014 and started selling about 5 months ago.    Their services are going downhill the past 9 months, I just hope the Kering investment would bring V back to a decent platform once again!","title":"To SELLER\u2014be aware","stars":1,"location":"HK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=63&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-09","author":"Joanne","text":"I have just received an email this evening after I sold a brand new pair of shoes with original packaging saying that the buyer has flagged up an issue and that they may send the goods back to me and not pay me.

Recently they've also started a rule where they'll delist your items after a certain number of days (60 days after posting, i.e. only two months!) if you don't confirm.
