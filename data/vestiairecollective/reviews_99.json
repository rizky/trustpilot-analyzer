On august 25th i sold a chanel item. Shipped in in august 26th and they received it on august 27th. Shortly I received an email saying thay in order to proove the authenticity of the item i have to send them a copy of the invoice. The funny thing is that I actually bought that item on VC so it has already been authenticated once by them ?!?! Now they are questioning their own professionalism... anyway, I immediately sent an email with all the information- order no, date of purchase, date of declaration of conform, etc and said that actually the invoice i have is from them. Received an authomatic answer that my email is being processed and wil get a reply in 48 hours. Guess what? 48 years passed, no reply but instead i am getting a reminder to send the requested information. So i am left with no choice but to contact customer service via the app which is always a bummer. I do so, explain and they say - ignore the reminder if you have sent the information. I am asking whether they received my email - they say yes. Good thing that i have horrible experience and this taught me never to take they answers seriously but to keep asking - so i am asking - what does my email say? Of course i receive the answer - we have not received it .... so ok i have to resend again. Unfortunately i do not even get shocked by their consistent ridiculousness and lack of professionalism. But it is still\nFrustrating because they are wasting my time, they keep the buyer waiting, the do not even check their emails and are actually doing nothing but questioning their own authentication... and it is a dead end because nobody actually cares to do their job. It is a constant rollacoaster with them. Few transaction go fine and then some crazy thing happens when you least expect it and the worst part - for obviously no realistic reason.

I asked VC few times about the progress as the seller use other delivery than DHL. And after 23 days waiting for it I saw there's a new post selling exactly the same belt. So I msg VS saying that's very strange and I hope the seller is not re posting my belt. They replied me like it won't happen as the belt will arrive their warehouse. \nAfter a day, they told me they've made a mistake and the item was sold to the new buyer. \nI do not understand what is the logic behind this. I paid and I was waiting and asking the situation of my belt. And now they told me it was sold?\nWhy don't them tell the new buyer that they made a mistake and cannot sell to her I stead?\n\nSo I have no choice but got refunded. \nThey didn't even gave me a apology until I send an email to them saying I'm very disappointed. \nThey gave me a EUO15 coupon. Which is not even enough for the shipping as a compensation. \n\n\nSecondly\nTherefore I was waiting and I found another good deal for another hermes belt on their website. \nI bought it immediately. \nPayment was made. I got the SMS and bank notification Immediately. \nHowever I was waited for few hours there was no order number no email saying my order has been made. \nSo I used the live chat to ask VC what was wrong and at the end ofcourse. They refund me. \n\nEven I wrote email told them I bought it immediately when it was out and they didn't even care. It was the technical problem of the app and I lost another good deal. \n\nI checked my bank another day and they refunded me the incorrect amount. \nThey still own me EUO83!\n\nSo I emailed them and online chat with them for many times and I showed the proof of my bank and everything. \nThey kept saying I should contact my bank. \nAlright. I contacted my bank and asked for every transactions between this company. \nThey told me there's no charges or exchange fees.

Obviously, I can't call anyone in VC and so called \"chat support\" is completely useless, feedback form takes 3 days to get back to you with useless answer.

The only communication you are dignified with is with very junior people in support, some of them are nice and some of them can be even rude. I am okay with cheaper items but for really valuable items (mine was about 20,000 dollars - for the record) and premium commission I am expecting smoothest possible communication which is not there.\nSecondly, communication again. Expected authentication time is within 6 days which did not happen. Why not dignify your clients with an update that it will take longer time? Instead, I am having stupid responses like \"oh we are swamped blah blah blah\". Really? I sold another item after my super valuable one (also jewellery but cheaper), passed authentication same day it was received.\nI will write special separate review about overall experience on VC as a seller and honestly people - you have to do something to treat your clients with more respect.
