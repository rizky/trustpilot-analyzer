I am currently in constant emailing with them, but i am talking and arguing with a dead horse.\nI ordered a vintage Chanel bag from a so called \u201cexpert seller\u201d, and payed for the \u201cquality control\u201d and \u201cauthentication process\u201d. Both these so called control processes are horrible and mean nothing! You only lose money to be lied to.\n\nThe seller stated that a button in the bag was not fully working as new, but that it could easily close, would not pop open AND would be an easy fix. All three turned out to be false. Of course Vestiaire passed the bag as compliant, because easy money for them with their abnormal high fees and commissions.\n\nThe bag is BROKEN, the seller lied to everyone about the current state, as this button was very much completely broken and unfixable by Chanel, leather spa\u2019s, handbag spa\u2019s and cobblers. This is unacceptable.\nI immediately filed complaints with vestiaire and they kept telling me the bag was compliant. After haven spoken to like 6 different staff members, someone told me to ship it back. Which i immediately did, ONLY TO HAVE THE BAG SHIPPED BACK TO ME WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION!! Someone else from the website offered me 10% off, but i just wanted to leave this ugly, broken bag behind me. After having it back i immediately spoke ip again and i could only relist it. I do NOT want to have to resell a faulty bag. It feels immoral and cruel to lie about the condition of expensive luxury goods like these.\nI now have relisted it, but i am still not done with the demand for a return! You can tell me all you want how the bag was deemed compliant, but it did not match the description at all! And yet, the seller gets her money and is still a so called expert seller.\n\nI am currently still in contact with vestiaire and will not back down unless i can return it and have them sell the bag themselves. \nI also escalated the claim with klarna and my bank account, to have the payment charged back. If needed i am filing an official small claim in court. This is unacceptable and their whole business model is shady and even prohibited by EU consumers law.\n\nHere to warn possible future buyers. Don\u2019t trust their \u201cquality control\u201d and don\u2019t purchase from private sellers, as they do not allow you to return anything, even when it is not matching the description. This act by them alone is already prohibited by EU law, hence i am excalating the claim by my bank.\n\nAnd to Vestiaire, y\u2019all know what issue i am talking about. I have no patience left anymore and am not paying for the junk you guys sent me. I will pull through with the claim through my bank and have the payment charged back. Tomorrow i\u2019ll ship the bag back again and you can do whatever y\u2019all want with it.","title":"Horrible experience with the worst \u201cquality control\u201d","stars":1,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-08-11","author":"Mel","text":"If I can give 0 stars I would.

It is nice to read an answer that is longer than 3 sentences, which is what I had received so far when contacting you via your \u201cHelp\u201d or \u201cHow-to-contact-Vestiaire-Collective\u201d, which is also why I have no intention to use those options, so no need to send these links again in future answer. \n\nI also feel that answering you here is far more helpful to other VC users.  \n\nAs written in my first review here below and as communicated with your \u201csupport\u201d several times: the sale was canceled due to your mistake without even contacting the carrier nor myself. When I contact you (via your \u201csupport\u201d), I provided  with a proof that UPS and myself shipped the item on time. Moreover, the buyer did not cancel the sale but you did. She wrote me in a comment that she contact you because she didn\u2019t understand why the sale was canceled. Strangely enough, you deleted these comments after the second time I contact your \u201csupport\u201d. \n\nAfter the third chat with your \u201csupport\u201d my item was sent back to me without any consulting nor mentioning the buyer. On the App however it is still \u201cin progress \u2014 item assessment\u201d. Strangely#2. \n\n   \nI\u2019m still waiting to your solution on this lost sale. To quote your motto and goal as written in your answer to me here below: \u201cwe will solve this issue because our staff has one and only goal: help our members until a satisfying solution and make you happy!\u201d\n\nPlease solve.\nref. #11907221\n\n\n...\n\n11 august 2021\n\nFirst, I wish I knew this website before having my stuff on Vestiaire Collective.\n\nNow, this is the first time I make an actual complain because this experience was extremely disturbing. Especially because it could have been so easy to solve. But the Support does not support nor communicate with the users in a transparent and honest way. And this is not Okay. \n\nIn short: I sold an item and shipped it on time. Apparently, VC did not register it as shipped on time so they canceled the sale. I only heard about it because the buyer wrote a comment on the item's sale page asking about it. Confused just as her, I tried to reach the support of VC and have it solved asap. Once told my item was not shipped on time, I sent a clear proof from UPS that it was handed on time to them. Strangely enough, after the first chat with the Support the item was somehow tracked and appeared as shipped! And few days later in the warehouse to be checked. \nThe \u201csupport\u201d by the way never updated me as he promised. Everything I found was via the App or the website. \n\nAnother things that happened was that VC deleted the item\u2019s sale page including the comments related to it. In the comments one could read the buyer expressing her confusion from VC and her desire to purchase this item. My last respond to her was not to worry and that the item would eventually reach her\u2026 how naive. But at that time, I really thought this could be solved easily. \n\nAfter the \u201citem check\u201d at VC warehouse seemed to take forever (6 days), I contact VC again. the \u201csupport\u201d, who apologized for this whole inconvenience, assured me that the matter would be solved including contacting the buyer to let them know the item was available. Ironically, few hours after chatting with her and another support person, I got an email from DHL that the item is being shipped back to my place. \nWhy? \nAnd why no one consulted\/ updated me?\nAnd what about taking responsibility for making me loos a sale? not to mention a compensation. \nI tried to get answers again from the \u201csupport\u201d but it seems like even when communicating with a human it is also copy\/paste answers. A lot of apologies, very little action. \n\nAfter searching on the web for reviews about VC I realized that I was not alone. This gave some comfort but also an urge to make it public. Because like said above, this is not Okay.  There is a serious problem with the way VC handles the items and their sellers\/buyers.\n\n\nPS. And on top of that VC noted on my profile that I \"Usually ship in More than 7 days\". Do the departments in VC are in communication with each other?","title":"We truly apologize for the inconvenience. Do you?","stars":1,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-08-11","author":"JRob","text":"Wow, Vestiaire Collective, you\u2019ve done it again. You\u2019ve managed to screw up in ways that exceed my wildest imagination to prove that the first time you screwed up was not a one-time event that deserved a mulligan, but instead a pattern of almost impressive incompetence and lack of regard for your customers.\n\nQuick background: I wrote a first review for VC on August 17, 2020, which you can easily find on this page, detailing my very negative first experience with the company. Long story short, I ordered an item that was badly damaged (that damage not being detailed in the item listing of course) but I did not inspect it within the return time period since I was moving and packed the item away quickly, and furthermore this happened in the middle of COVID which makes everything more difficult. I very apologetically asked VC if they would make a one-time exception due to extenuating life circumstances and offer me a refund, and they totally refused even though the damage on this item was ridiculous\u2014torn plackets on *both* sleeves of a silk shirt. Only when I wrote a scathing review about my experience on Trustpilot did they contact me and offer me a store credit voucher in the amount of the shirt, which isn\u2019t as ideal as a refund but fine, I guess. They did something purely because they did not want their public reputation damaged. I was still not pleased with the situation but at least they finally agreed to rectify it a *little* bit.\n\nFast forward to now\u2014my voucher was about to expire (really weird to have store credit expire because no other company does that, but okayyy I guess) so I placed another order for two sweaters. The total amount of the order exceeded the voucher amount so the remaining amount was charged to my card, which is fine, that\u2019s to be expected. I loved one of the sweaters but the other sweater arrived with\u2014you guessed it!\u2014a hole in the sleeve. I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s the seller\u2019s responsibility or VC\u2019s responsibility to accurately list the quality of the item including any flaws, but I know that VC inspects all items before they are finally sent to the buyer, so with this in mind I find it outrageous that they failed to detect a major defect in an item not once but TWICE (remember the previous order that I wrote a review for!). So this time I made sure to request a refund and send the item back within the time span specified by their policy\u2014since that\u2019s what I had trouble with before\u2014and they agreed to refund me for the one sweater. It's a significant problem that they seem incapable of accurately describing the quality of their items, but I thought fine, I\u2019ll take the refund, this should work out.\n\nAn important thing to point out here is that I specifically requested to customer service that I receive a refund of the excess I paid to my card (the price for the one sweater encompassed that entire amount), because it makes sense to use up my whole store credit voucher and receive a refund of the excess charge instead of receiving another voucher, no? When I mentioned this point they didn\u2019t say there would be a problem with it, so I figured all would be good and I\u2019d just wait for the refund on my card.\n\nSo I finally see the pending refund appear on my credit card account and it\u2019s for less than half of the original amount I was charged. WHAT. I immediately contacted customer service through their chat function and they told me to wait until the refund actually posted because I might receive an additional refund for the other portion later\u2026 oookay\u2026 sure. So I waited a few more days and lo and behold, I still ended up only receiving that first refund for less than half of what I was owed. Absolutely preposterous.\n\nNaturally, I contacted customer service again and they told me they would escalate the issue and get back to me soon over email. Fine. As long as this gets rectified, I\u2019m willing to play. So then a few days later I receive another email from VC claiming their Accounting team verified that the refund was made properly and that I should \"kindly coordinate this to [my] bank\" if the refund was still not reflected in my account. EXCUSE ME? What in the f***?!? I would like to add that my account on their actual website shows that a refund for the entire amount was processed, which is an even more confusing contradiction.\n\nSo now I\u2019ve filed a chargeback claim with my bank for the remaining amount because these utter fools at VC have entirely failed to do their job competently to the point of hardly even doing their job at all. I wish I could go back in time and never even order from them in the first place; I wish I had never heard of this website at all.

Users are perfectly aware that you are not working on improving anything. This is just sand in the eyes. And nobody even expects you to fix anything.

It takes forever to get your payment. Vestiaire also changes the text in your listings (!!) so that it might end up not be what you wrote about the items. As a seller you can't change in a listing once it is uploaded, and if you lower the price of an item it can't be changed back. \n\nAs a buyer, there is no help at all if the item does not match its description. The authentication is a joke, as it feels if they do not look at the item at all, and even less compare the item with its description. Worn items are listed as new, and items that are clearly only in fair condition can be rated as good or even very good condition, with no flaws described.

Later on they reassured me that they are considering my case and payment will be done on time. Another week passed. \nDespite the receiving email I have not moved any further,  they did not provide me with any information and I still haven't received any payment. \nThey just mentioned about customer's concern or delivery failure.\nSo, I have done my own research and found out, that the customer has already received the item on the delivery day, has already weared it and shared a post on Instagram. \nI have sent to the Customer Service all screen shots evidence (delivery confirmation,  screen shots customer address,  name,  Instagram profile, \nthe customer wearing the boots) and still haven't got any response. \nI am considering to contact the police and make fraud concern about their customer,  because seems to me that they are not helping to sellers at all and just deliberately delaying the payment. \nThey keep sending their apologies yet it doesn't help me to sort it out. \n\nI am complaining about their customer service. \nThe responding person was very rude by rushing to close the chat and I believe they do not try to sort out things yet just pretend to do so.","title":"Very rude customer service","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
