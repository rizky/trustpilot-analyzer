I\u2019m now left waiting for a response and cannot move forward with re listing my item until I have reply from the \u201cexpert team\u201d  I have to wait.. with my bag sat in their offices... Awful.  \n**update** surprise, surprise, VC eventually got back to me 5 days later and after me chasing them 14 times, to say they found my raincoat.. as they informed my buyer already that my item was missing a piece noted in the description my buyer cancelled!

Why?  it is a very common word used for selling branded used bags online\n2) Every listing seems to use the same photos for the same model of bags they sell online.  Agree?\n3) Lack of detailed descriptions.  All listings are the same - very brief words for selling such expensive and branded items.  Dodgy isn't it?\n4) Go to their Facebook Page - They removed the REVIEWS Tab and also all negative comments on their Posts are being removed or hidden.  Strange isn't it?\nI hope my doubts are unfounded  but if i were to read up more about VC online in here, i won't buy from them.
