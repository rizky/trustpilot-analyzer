Unfortunately. When you pass the point of being disappointed it is just funny. As i have said previously- expect the worst and VC will not disappoint. So for that reason they do not do so anymore. But it funny and yet another explicit example how completely ignorant the team behind the company is.\nAt the beginning of the summer I listed a pair of brand new Chanel jeans. Being actually slightly thick and from a winter collection (pre-fall 2016) , i decided to take them off as i had a pile of summer pre-loved items which were more logical to sell during summer. So i did so. Now being already fall season, i decided to list the item again as they are much more appropriate to be worn in the upcoming months so the chances of selling increase. Guess what - this time VC refused my listing because from the pictures they \u201ccould not verify the authenticity of the item\u201d. Funny\ud83d\ude02. First - i used the same pictures that i took in the summer and the same exact description, but now obviously their \u201cexpert \u201c team lost the little expertise that they have left in them and they decided to refuse the listing. \nWhat can i say more - the list of obscenties that VC has to offer is long and broad, and it is just to be expected to get worse, although their constant templates of  \u201creassurances \u201c that they are constantly \u201cworking on improving \u201c. Guess what - if you are really working on something, you can actually eventually manage. The case with VC is just the opposite.

I have had so many issues with them, which really seems that you are speaking to robots. On September 11, I sold Balenciaga belt, direct shipping, item 15817043, posted the item with DHL using the label provided. Two days later, I noticed that the shipping details were not updated on their website and emaild them to say that I had already sent the item, but it was shown as not dispatched yet. The operator said that all was fine. One month later, the item still shows as being on transit and of course that I was not paid. I contacted them and the operator said once again that it was still on transit. I insisted that it could not be possible, as it does not take 30 days to deliver the item. Since then, they ask me to send the proof of postage, which I sent, plus my ID to start the claim process. I did not buy myself the label, it was VC, and even if I had, I am not going to send copy of my ID by email to VC or DHL. This is an abbusive policy and illegal, because commercial companies cannot demand copy of passports or IDs from consumers. only governmental agencies or those who perform related services, such as airline companies can ask this, but the information needs to be encripted and they follow specific procedures and the operators that work in these departments have special certificates, by law. Finally, my role with VC obbliges me to disptach the item within a certain deadline, the delivery service is their responsibility.","title":"Abbusive policy","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=41&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-11","author":"Zu\u00f1iga Medina Geovani","text":"I just bought a Cartier belt and the received product had a lot of damage and scratches at the buckle that wasn't shown at the photographs. \n\nWorst is that at the revision done at Vestiaire (supposedly comparing with the item description and photos) the 'inspector' approves it.\n\nIs incredible that one item is shown and that you receive another damaged that was approved against the listing.\n\nNEVER BUY FROM VESTIAIRE AGAIN, Please take care and avoid you being part of the fraud that Vestiaire Collective is.","title":"I just bought a Cartier belt and the\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=41&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-11","author":"Jadwiga","text":"Company is pretending to be reliable and trustworthy, only because of website platform.
