[{"date":"2021-12-30","author":"Anonymous","text":"I sold an expensive bag on December 11th.  Shipped to VC on the 12th.  FedEx delivered the 13th (even tho their system claims the 14th).  It has been well over the 6 days VC is supposed to clear and send the item to buyer.  I even emailed the purchase receipt for the item I sold, in the hope it would expedite the process.  I've been very patient considering holidays\/COVID.  NO ONE from VC has contacted me about any delays.  I have no product, nor money to show for the sale.  I've contacted \"customer service\" multiple times, with no answers and instead the run-around.  If I am not paid soon, I will be escalating this issue to the proper authorities.\n\nUPDATE: It was only after this post that I got my sold item processed and finally received payment.  It took over 3 weeks, with no updates or communication from VC.  This is unacceptable.  Sellers are held to a standard to ship their items within a specified time frame.  In theory, so is VC, until they don't and you have no way to follow-up because they have horrible customer service.","title":"Sold Item, No Payment","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-31","author":"Ays","text":"I have sold balenciaga triple s sneakers at VC.

I do.\n\nToday I receive an email to say it has passed once more and has been relisted on my account, what?

I don't want a voucher, I want a REFUND. I don't want the bag relisted on my account for somebody else to be essentially scammed and for Vestiaire to profit off the ADDED COMMISSION!, and I don't want it shipped back to me, it's DODGY. I want my hard-earned money back!\n\nUpdate, 27th January: Earlier in the month Vestiaire eventually agreed to refund me after much back-and-fourth with a customer service department that could be compared to conversing with a broken robot, but by that point I had already disputed the charge with American Express, and had my money rightfully returned to me. \n\nThey say in their email the item will be \u201cexceptionally relisted under Vestiaire Collective\u201d\u2026 right, so somebody else will have the exact same problem. \n\nHaving \u00a3600 stuck in limbo has caused me so much stress.

I sold my item Ref. 18871106 on 10\/30\/21. VC emailed me and I sent the item to the Buyer 11\/1\/21 using the address provided to me from VC. On VCs website I notified them that the package had been sent and provided the USPS Tracking No. I contacted the Buyer on 11\/9\/21 to let them know their package was on it's way. For some unknown reason from the date the package was picked up at the P.O. 11\/1\/21 it was held in NJ for 8 days.  I received another email that the item had been Authenticated. The buyer did not receive the package until 11\/10\/21. I asked VC when would I receive payment.  They told me after they rec'd confirmation from the Buyer, I would receive payment, but I should wait to hear from them. They contacted the Buyer who said they had no problems with the item. The next email said that payment had been triggered and to expect any day. After waiting several days, I contacted VC again to find out the status of payment. They said the Buyer had cancelled the order and had been refunded the money owed to me. I have sent attachments of my usps tracking receipts, copies of emails from Customer Service, chats conversations. They have not sent me back my Balenciaga Boots worth $400 to me. Nor paid me because the Buyer decided to keep the boots.  All I've gotten from VC is they are working on returning the item to me or getting back the refund they sent to the Buyer. I don't care what they do, all I want is either payment for my sale; or return my merchandise to me.\nI wish I had known there were so many complaints against this consignment site.

I was asked to return the item within 7 days, and they\u2019d get back to me within 5 days. It took them 2 weeks to get back to me.\n\nInstead of providing a refund,they\u2019ve relisted the counterfeit item for sale on my account.

So I won\u2019t get the full amount back, or potentially anything back if it doesn\u2019t sell.\n\nThis means they make 2 sets of fees, one from my purchase and anither from the resale.

I am also being forced into selling a counterfeit item under my account (which is illegal).\n\nI\u2019ve asked for a full report from their authenticity check but all I get told is: \u2018They have concluded that the item meets the standards of the brand\u2018 and they checked \u2018Leather, stitching and finishes, metal parts.\u2019 These checks mean absolutely nothing, checking the \u2018standard of the bag\u2019 is very different from checking its authenticity. Many counterfeits are made to a high standard, with real leather, good stitching and high quality trims. So the only way to check their authenticity is to check the RFID, serial numbers, or labels\u2014 which they don\u2019t do. \n\nAlso worth noting that at no point have they told me that they found the item to be genuine. Despite selling it as an \u2018authenticity check\u2019 they\u2019ll only confirm the \u2018quality\u2019 of the item to me and refuse to provide details on any checks related to labels, serial number, and receipts.","title":"Fake item\u2014 Refused refund but they\u2019ve kept the item","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-04","author":"Jane","text":"Should have received money almost a month ago.\nI have contacted VCs customer service more that 12 times now but they only reply when I make a post here on trustpilot and they only reply ones but with no resolution at all only that they will look into it. \nNow I made a sale over 1 month ago and still no money or any help or solution from VC.\nI an low loosing my home because the VC will not pay out my money?\nI have made 94 sale trough VC","title":"No payment, no help or solution from VC","stars":1,"location":"DK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
