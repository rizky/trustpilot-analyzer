I know this is not vestiares fault necessarily, but it has certainly put me off buying from their site moving forward, as I don't like the uncertainty. I think there needs to be more incentive for sellers to actually go through with the purchase\/more consequences if they don't as on no other site have I had so many orders cancelled without explanation!

Below, you are, once again, NOT giving an asnwer, as well as you never never asnwered my mail where i am asking you for evidence that the rules of the chat have been broken. And this is because you cannot provide any. And now you cannot \u201cverify\u201d my account. How \u201cconvenient\u201d. This is another ridiculous comment from your side. If there are \u201cmany humans\u201d in your self-proclaimed \u201ccustomer service\u201d do the work and answer my email and  do not waste your time and my time with \u201cofficial \u201c copy\/paste\u201d meaningless answers which indeed do NEVER provide any actual answers.\nRules are to be respected but they are to be respected from both sides of a contract, partnership, whatsoever. If you decide to \u201cpunish\u201d someone you should provide evidence or explanation why so. But as you cannot, this action of yours is again a display of your autocratic manner of doing \u201cbusiness\u201d. Which is offensive and in breach of your own rules and regulations. Very typical and consistent manner of yours and a reason why more and more users are complaining from your company. Anyway. Nothing surprising when it comes to your company\u201d\n\n\u2026.\n\n VC managed to \u201coutdo\u201d themselves once again. Today i noticed that they have banned me from the chat which came as a shock. I have only used the chat to answer questions (very rarely actually)  from potential buyers about dimensions or when asked to provide product details. Moreover, this is an option that VC is giving and even enhancing you to use. I Have never discussed anything else and this can easily be varified by them if they bother to check their records. But as we all know truth and facts are not something VC cares about as they are totally autocratic and dismissive to their customers and still do whatever and whever they want to do, without basing their actions on any grounds. and when i sent an email asking for an explanation, i received a template response what might be the reason - with a list of potential misdemeanors which i have never ever performed. Not a single one of them. And this can be proven. But as it is impossible to talk to or communicate with a real person from the non-existent customer service, lets just add to the list one more, ridiculous and illogical action from the side of the gimmick company. \nNot that this review will help getting the matter resolved. It never does. But it is an additional fact that can raise awareness to the malpractices and many scams that VC is performing while totally mistreat they long term customers.","title":"Abusive actions from the side of VC","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=9&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-29","author":"Titty Kardashian","text":"Scammers full stop \ud83d\uded1\n\nRead review CANT all be wrong \nDon\u2019t waste time or money","title":"Scammers full stop \ud83d\uded1","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=9&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-29","author":"Ioanna","text":"Sold a Dior Columbus bag on Vestiaire, which on quality control was assessed as \"Very good condition\" and not \"Never worn\" as I had written in the description.

Each of my last 4 purchases has a problem with shipping and both seller and buyer do not understand why they continue to cancel purchases.

The people on these chats have no insight or ability to sort things out and say they will refer to experts who never respond. It is a complete shambles and i have spent hours of time following up to locate parcels or sort matters. VC way to deal with this is to cancel el chat or just leave it while you are trying to work toward a possible explanation. It is so frustrating. One of my sales was cancelled and I don\u2019t know why, but they still have my item!  The shipping labels given to 2 different sellers had the wrong postcode in a different part of U.K. on the labels - it is shocking.
