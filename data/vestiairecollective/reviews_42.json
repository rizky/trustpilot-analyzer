They treat sellers like cash cows and have no time or respect to actually assess a situation and resolve issues to a satisfactory standard.\nThey recently sabotaged a sale that I had agreed and was going through with a buyer for a worn once Roland\u2019s Mouret dress. After nearly 10 days, no sign of any money in my account despite having alerts to say authentication complete. \nThe seller contacted me directly to ask me \u2018why I had cancelled the sale?\u2019, I knew nothing about this. Contacted Vestiare and they said initially they knew nothing about the sale being cancelled, I waited days then had to contact e chats for hours, before insisting on speaking to a person accept an from overseas call centre. Eventually,  Vestiare admitted they did cancel the sale because they said the dress didn\u2019t meet their authentic policy: because there was no size label. This was not true. The dress did have a size label. I sent a picture to prove it. They agreed to their mistake. By this time, it was nearly 2 weeks later, and the seller stopped responding and sale never went through. They sent the dress back to me and told me to relist it. I was so angry they offered me a \u00a350 voucher to say a belated \u2018sorry\u2019 but the voucher was never approved snd I received nothing and I heard nothing more. No record of e chat so I would have to explain the whole sorry story to someone else.\n\nWhy did they not just contact me first to ask me about their concerns regarding the label - that turned out to be their incompetence? \n\nThat was for nearly \u00a3194.00\nI was so angry as it was the time and effort trying to relist.

First time they got my postcode wrong so it was returned to France and then I had to liase with them to get it sent back out...even though the address on my account was correct. 2nd item, a Joseph coat, I chose direct shipping, seller was UK based and I felt confident in not needing the verification service. This time the sender sent the item in a couple of days and I received notification that my item would be delivered by Hermes, but to my local parcel shop. Its not a major issue but I would have liked to be told this was happening beforehand. However in the spirit of lowering emissions, I was happy to walk up the road to collect it when it arrived. Now over the course of this week I have received notification from Hermes that my parcel is ready to collect on 3 different days. Each time, my parcel has not been there.

Only occasionally are they are fluent and able to communicate in English.  If you do not reply for 1 minute, they will end the chat to avoid helping you further.\n\nThe system where a sale will be cancelled if not shipped within 7 days is horrible as well.

The overall experience is good and I can't say that I have faced any major problems with payments or lost items (as mostly described in bad reviews). My big problem with the application is that the customer service is somewhat non-existened. Some designer bags I own (which have all been bought at boutiques and have serial numbers) have been refused. Recently, a pair of Louis Vuitton sneakers and a Vintage Gucci bag (both in very good condition) were refused with the automated explanation via email that they couldn't verify their authenticity. This is strange because the LV sneakers came with their box, and even the small booklet that comes with LV shoes bought straight from a boutique. As far as the Gucci bag is concerned, it is in very good condition, and I've come across bags of the same model in other used item reseller apps. It was bought from the Gucci boutique in Paris back in 1998 and the only defect it has is a very small scratch which is only visible in very bright lighting. Moreover, a Balenciaga work handbag that i bought from the Balenciaga store in Harvey Ninchols London was refused in the same way, with an automated explaination about not being able to verify its authenticity etc etc. When I contacted Customer Service I only received automated replies that weren't at all helpful. It is sad that such a popular app does not offer customer service and does not make you feel that you are being heard and that someone is actually working to solve the issue or give you a more specified report\/ ask you for more info etc. Not only is this bad for the site because it pushes users towards different apps but also they are actually losing money this way. Moreover, this whole procedure ends up becoming intimidating. For me, reselling staff was a very enjoyable and fulfilling experience that has just started turning into a nightmare. UPDATE: 1 of the rejected items was accepted after I tried uploding one more time.

I was a first time buyer with them who purchased a pair of Chanel earrings on 9\/7\/21. I had received discounts totaling $99.99 (a 12% cash back RetailMeNot cash back offer ($50), $30 off $300 promo, and $19.99 ship fee waiver (suppose to be refund) for first time buy honored by rep. (The ship fee \"refund\" was compensation I asked for because VC 1) insisted I should be charged a customs fee when seller was in my country, and 2) because the $50 off $150 in app was not working.) THE VC \"EXPERT TEAM\" WRONGLY CLAIMED THE EARRINGS INAUTHENTIC AND CANCELED MY ORDER. Both the seller and I knew the earrings were authentic. THE SELLER HAD RECEIPT FROM THE BOUTIQUE. VC FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THEY MADE THE WRONG ASSESSMENT BUT REFUSED TO REINSTATE THE SALE, AND WHILE WE WERE BACK-AND-FORTH TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A RESOLUTION, THEY SOLD MY EARRINGS TO SOMEONE ELSE. VC WOULD NOT HONOR THE DISCOUNTS I ORIGINALLY HAD WITH THE PURCHASE AND THEY WERE EXPECTING ME TO PAY THEM FOR A WRONG AUTHENTICATION ($28.50). \nTo date, I am still trying to get them to right their wrong here. I AM NOT INTERESTED IN ANY PAIR OF EARRINGS.  I WANT THE EARRINGS I PAID FOR, WHICH ARE A HARD FIND FROM A PRIOR COLLECTION.  THE FINANCIAL LOSS AND STRESS THEY CAUSED ME IS VALUED FAR MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE EARRINGS. The RetailMeNot cash back offer is no longer effective. They are dishonest and claim they provided a refund of the ship fee, but they did not. They merely canceled the order. While in reconciliation process, I was unable to buy the earrings at the cost I originally had due to their error. The best I got from them is excess stress and a $30 promo. I insisted that VC reinstate my order AND inform the buyer that THESE earrings were already purchased. VC currently has the earrings and has not mailed them out to the buyer yet.  THEY MUST CANCEL THAT ORDER AND SEND ME MY EARRINGS. THIS IS ALL DUE TO THEIR ERROR. This is the only resolution I see short of a lawsuit.  PLEASE BUYERS BEWARE: VC DOES NOT HAVE EXPERT CHANEL AUTHENTICATORS. THEY CANNOT DIFFERENTIATE WHAT IS FAKE FROM WHAT IS REAL. They cause more trouble than anything else.\n\nUPDATE 10\/15\/21: Immediately after VC replied here on 10\/11\/21, I emailed them the reference number they requested and the following: \n\n\"To whom it may concern: \n\nThere is no other earring that I am interested in.  I want the ones that I purchased. \n\nYou have acknowledged VC error in stating the earrings were inauthentic, and you have acknowledged your error in cancelation of my order.  \n\nYou are aware that I purchased those earrings and still reposted them and sold them to someone else, after I had made it very clear that I would repurchase them for the price I paid.  \n\nThe only resolution, short of a lawsuit, is to inform the buyer of your error, cancel their order, and prepare my invoice to repurchase my earrings with the $180 euro voucher that Morgane claimed I would be provided.  \n\nLook forward to hearing from the individual who replied to the review.\"\n\nYesterday, 10\/14\/21, I received a generic message addressed not to me, but to \"{ticket.requester.first_name}\".  This was a new email separate from the original back-and-forth thread regarding the issues and they ask that I not email them again.  Seems as though they are trying to avoid accountability.  Again, they claim they will reply in 24hrs with the resolution, but still no answer from them.  The following is a copy of their email-->\n\n\"Hi {ticket.requester.first_name}},\n\nWe've not forgotten you!\n\nOur teams are still working on a solution for you, and we're really sorry for the unusual delay in getting back to you. We will be in touch within the next 24 hours to resolve your enquiry.\n\nWe understand it's frustrating to wait, but please don't submit your enquiry again as this can add to the waiting time.\n\nThank you for your patience.\n\nThe Vestiaire Collective team\n______________________________\nI am still waiting on the supposed call from management that Morgane said I would be receiving early this week.  I am also still waiting on the supposed $180 voucher she said I would receive and of course the earrings that I paid for.\n\nHere is the email from Morgane on 10\/8\/21: \n\"Morgane C (Support Vestiaire Collective)\nOct 8, 2021, 14:58 GMT+2\n\nDear Samira, \n \nWe will get back to you early next week to schedule a phone call. \n \nIndeed, our manager isn't available today to arrange a call as she has several meetings. \n\nKind Regards \nMorgane for Vestiaire Collective\"\n________________________________\nNow today, 10\/15\/21, the seller informs me thru Instagram that VC paid her today for the earrings and she has no idea who the earrings will be going \nto.\nIf the earrings are not on the way to me, a lawsuit will be filed.
