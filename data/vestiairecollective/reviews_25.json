I guess not.\nIt is all sand in the eyes of customers. Promises that are never kept. Not surprised because the email was never expected, but better stay silent rather than pretending that the matter will be \u201ctaken care of\u201d \u2026 so typical of VC\u2026anyway.\nUpdate:\nVC, \u201cthanks\u201d for your answer. But maybe if you ever bothered to read my comment carefully you would have understood that the complaint is not about the said item (btw, ref. 17131379; previously bought from you with ref. 5670063) as this matter was resolved - i got the refund for the initial purchase. The problem is the situation with the badge. You can see my comments from august. And also, AGAIN, i am copy\/pasting a reply from your agent on aug. 25th\n>>\u201cDear , \nMy name is Mariel and I am here to help with this matter. \nAlthough we are not able to reinstate the badge manually and I do understand the disappointment that losing it has caused, I would like to let you know that the badge will be automatically awarded based on the next few sales. \nI know that the loss of the badge was not your fault and we are truly sorry about the inconvenience this technical issue has caused. \nAs soon as you have fulfilled the shipping criteria again, your badge will be automatically reinstated.\nPlease let me know if you have any questions and thank you for your understanding.\u201d\n>>\n\nSo, if you manually could not restore my badge back then even though it was your mistake and you \u201cencouraged\u201d me to sell more, why your \u201ccomputer\u201d system does not follow its own rules for granting badges as i have sold 50+ since then?!?!?!?!\nI hope this time you actually UNDERSTAND right what i am talking about and stop giving ROBOTIC answers here.\nI have shared the most shoking bad experiences with VC here, most of them staggered last year, so i am not going to waste time to list and summerize them again. It is just obvious that the service of this company has gone from ok to ridiculously bad. Of course, truth to be told, a lot of the transactions do go smoothly, which should be normal pattern, not an exception. But when things mess up, there is no power that can make VC own up their own wrongdoings or fix their mistakes, there is no legitimate or adequate customer service, there is nothing. This is obvious and repeating pattern which is of course resulting in their overall ratings (as seen here) for which they seem not to care.\nAnyway, i wanted to share about another malfunction of their robotic website, which contradicts the rules they claim to follow.\nI have been selling since 2017. I was an expert seller. Till august, 2021 i have sold 414 items, all of them found compliant, shipped on time, etc. till they decided to declare one sold item \u201cfake\u201d although it was bought from them at first place and had once passed their \u201cquality control\u201d. After a dreadful back and forth communication at least the item was refunded to me, so that part was ok. But they wrongfully stripped me of my \u201cexpert\u201d seller badge. They admitted that mistake, they promised to restore it (i have many emails as proofs of their un-kept promises), till one day someone decidee to admit   - \u201cyes, our mistake, BUT there is nothing we can do, we just encourage you to sell more to gain it back\u201d  Whatever. Fine.  But what is contradictive to their own \u201crules\u201d is the fact that since that \u201cincident\u201d, created by them, occured, i have sold additionally more than 50 items in 4 months. All shipped on time and all found compliant. By their own \u201cregulations\u201d you need to sell at least 2 items in period of six months which need to be shipped on time and found compliant to get a \u201ctrusted seller\u201d badge and at least 5 items in six months to get an \u201cexpert seller badge\u201d (or in my case the badge that was wrongfully taken away to be restored). So, i did actually sell more than 50 + items in 4 months, but my badge status is still \u201cin progress\u201d and shows that zero items have been found compliant, although actually ALL the items have been found compliant.\nIt is not a big deal, with the time you learn not to sweat over their bulshit and just to expect it, but it is just an observation of another malpractice and another self-contradictory \u201cstrict\u201d  rule that they so \u201cproudly \u201c claim that they follow, but actually just misinform, mis-follow and just do not stand behind by their own \u201cregulations \u201c.
