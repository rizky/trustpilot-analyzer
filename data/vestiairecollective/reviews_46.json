Because if so, then its fraudulent and theft. I do not think that is a good way to run your company. I regularly shop with this company, and never had a problem until now. I had confidence that they will be more than willing to resolve the issues but as of late, the customer service at this company has provided little to no help protecting and helping me as a buyer. I purchased an item over 3 weeks ago and according to its tracking number there is a delay in Vestiaire receiving the item from the seller through UPS. I am not the seller and therefore it is not my responsibility to ensure package arrival or delivery to Vestiaire. If the package does not make it to you by the way of the seller in an appropriate length of time, then an immediate action should be taken to ensure that the buyer either gets credit OR a refund; but neither has happen and that is considered THEFT. Vestiaire has my money and i STILL HAVE NO ITEM. Vestiaire, cancel this order and return to me my money! I will provide an update on this matter.\n\nUpdate: 10\/6\/21\n12:41EST\nSomeone reached out to me and fully resolved the issue. I was refunded my money in full.

The item I've bought has been confirmed as genuine and compliant. Shipping lead time is supposed to 0-1 days from compliance. 6 days later still no shipping info and customer service via chat can not tell me what the hold up is or even when the item will be shipped. This will be last time ordering from VC because as the company has grown and turns over millions, the service has got worse. Clearly no investment is going into offering decent customer service. There are many other platforms that sell similar designer items and so I'll take my business elsewhere.\n\nEdit. I see the only way to get a quick response from VC is to leave a review on TP. Seems pointless having a chat function on their platform. Customer Service now claims it\u2019s the billing address why there\u2019s hold up with shipping my item. However they\u2019ve charged my credit card with the same billing address they claim is problematic. I placed an order in July and there were no issues with the address. It\u2019s the same address that\u2019s been on my account since I first joined in 2013. I have not moved home.
