[{"date":"2021-08-19","author":"Hauteclaire Stassin","text":"For the first time I feel I should actually spare a few minutes of my life to write the following, hoping that it can make a difference for even just one person. In short: avoid Vestiaire Collective, at all costs. \n\n1) VC customer service is appalling. Any problem you have to report becomes at best a time-wasting nightmare, at worst a money-wasting hell. \n\u2014 No contact number, only a chat \n\u2014 You have to go through an ill-designed automated customer service anyway\n\u2014 Staff is incompetent. They don't actually read complaints, they just deliver an empty apology and copy-paste a line taken from VC policy: totally unhelpful.\n\u2014 You\u2019ll be chatting with multiple agents to solve an issue and you\u2019ll have to spend time to catch them up with your issue and its status every time (again, they don\u2019t read) \n\u2014 You have to chase them to get updates, they\u2019re really not on top of things\n\u2014 They lie ALL THE TIME. And when you catch them in the middle of a lie, they continue to lie. This is quite difficult to handle \u2014 how do you deal constructively when confronting dishonesty? (Not a rhetorical question, I\u2019m really asking.)\n\nFrom a seller's POV: \n1) VC take too much from each sale without providing any kind of decent service\n2) They spam you to ask for price reduction several times a week (imagine if you have more than one item listed...)\n3) Their offer system is not binding. If you accept a lower offer from a potential buyer, they don't actually have to buy. However, people who previously liked your item will get a notification saying this: \u201cPssst! You didn't hear it from us, but another member has successfully negotiated the price of [Image of item]. The seller is ready to reduce their price to the amount shown below\u201d. From that point on, you will receive only same or lower offers... Very unlikely you\u2019ll sale at original price.\n3) There is always an excuse for payment issues\/delays: \n\u2014 Maybe it's your bank (it never is, believe me), in which case you have to check yourself and get back to them\n\u2014 Maybe VC didn't register the item as received, even after you got an email saying: \"your item was delivered 72 hours ago, and your buyer hasn\u2019t flagged any problems. Your payment will be issued within 5 working days\u201d. \n4) Their authentication process is a joke (more on that later), same for the verification: they constantly find issues on new items and cancel your sale or ask you to revise the price substantially. Imagine you accept to lower your price by \u00a3200, only to find out later through the buyer chat that he\/she accepted a \u00a3100 discount\u2026 You read that right: VC will blatantly lie to make more than you think from a sale! \n5) \"Direct shipping\" offers no protection: if you send an item that gets damaged in transit or by the buyer, VC will cancel the sale and return your broken item without compensation. As a seller, you\u2019ll always be the loser in a transaction.\n\nFrom a buyer's POV: \n1) Their authentication process is a joke: fakes are accepted all the time. Imagine: you paid the price for a real [whichever brand] + their authentication fees, and you get a fake. You're disappointed, but you can send it back within 72 hours so you don't worry. Then, VC tell you that they stand by their judgement, so they won't accept your return but give you the \"opportunity\" to relist without extra charge. If you accept, you're selling an item that you know is fake, hoping to fool somebody else\u2026 Now, imagine that someone buys your item: you don't feel great about it, you send it anyway, and now VC say it's a fake and cancel the sale. The item is returned and you can't relist it. You've lost money, time, and ended up with an item you don't want in your closet.\n2) The verification process is another joke: they will send you a damaged item listed as \"new\", and when you complain they\u2019ll say that it was perfect when they inspected it. Again, that one will be on you.\n3) You find a rare item: you negotiate, you buy, you get a notification of the arrival at VC for authentication, and then it \u201cdisappears\u201d in the warehouse. You complain to get a refund (the seller may also get money from the sale but not necessarily: VC lie about receiving items if proof is missing). Meanwhile, someone in VC is most likely wearing or reselling the item you spent time negotiating for yourself\u2026 \n4) UK\/EU: they overcharged you with taxes even if the amount is below the threshold, and you cannot do anything about it. \n\nI know this is just another bad review added to the pile of so many others, and it\u2019s obvious that Vestiaire Collective do not care at all about bad reviews \u2014 I have no hope for any kind of change on their part. The only plausible option is to stop using their platform and start using others. The price of dishonesty should be self-destruction; so please, let's just all let Vestiaire Collective die.","title":"Avoid at all costs","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=48&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-08-19","author":"Beatnik","text":"So, what type of company marks a sold item you mailed to them \u201cdelivered on 23 June 2021\u201d \u201cin progress item assessment\u2026checking the item matches it\u2019s description and brand standards\u201d and then claims they do not have item and because no mail tracking, your problem.

The seller has been chasing Vestiaire with no joy from any customer service people, I have been talking to them for over a month also without any resolution at all. They have told me that the parcel is at the drop off point so I know the seller has done her job but it still hasn't moved and each rep that I speak to (a different one each time) keep saying exactly the same thing: they are investigating it, thank me for my patience and that they will be in touch when they can. My patience has totally run out, I'm moving house in 4 weeks time and at this rate I won't live at the property when (if!) it finally does arrive. I have asked them to just refund my item as it is clearly not going to be delivered to me, a few reps have said they will but generally they ignore my request completely and nothing happens. The seller only gets paid on a successful delivery so in theory they have not only taken my money, but also taken the seller's item.

From before they have a customer service line you can at least call to, to now there is basically no customer service at all. all inquiry will respond on their preference (I have gotten whole bunch legit inquiry that never gotten responded). Not even mentioning the high fee they charge, it is frustrated both as seller and buyer, because you cannot sell\/buy items at competitive rates. I always ended up selling at other sites instead of here... \n\nAt this point, I am just so exhausted with them and I am leaving VC for good.

Both purchases were cancelled after my payment was taken because the item isn\u2019t available. 1) Why are items listed that aren\u2019t available? Why doesn\u2019t VC require sellers to remove items or charge sellers for cancelling transactions? 2) Why does VC take payment from my card BEFORE ascertaining whether the item is available or not. They take your money and hold it for a few days before issuing a refund. The process is totally backwards - no money should be debited until VC checks that the item is actually available. \n\nI won\u2019t use the site again.\n\nEDIT: The response from VC below is disingenuous. The transactions were both cancelled because the item wasn\u2019t available (not because the sellers failed to send the item within 7 days).

To recap this company has no customer service at all and if you need to contact them it's a drama . Be careful and don't sell anything of real value directly !!
