[{"date":"2020-12-24","author":"Guy Verduystert","text":"Still not happy. The saga is ongoing. Notwithstanding the polite and standard answer from V, I am still waiting for my money. \"Good\" (sic) news is that finally after 4 weeks, V-people have realised that they could not transfer the money because I did not give them instructions where to transfer to. One it took them four weeks to realise this? Bad. Second, what about all those V-people telling me  different stories? Bad. \n\nFinally yesterday one V-star gave me the \"right\" instructions (step 1 - give transfer details). \n\nNo problem, I got through step 1. Step 2,   verification code to be sent to my email. Nada, never received an email. After ten attempts I gave up. The numerous subsequent emails were left unanswered. No communication, no assistance. Bad. \n\nExcept one V person contacted me basically telling me that my yahoo account was not the right one. I should change it to gmail. When asked how I should do this, she said to send me the old email (how stupid I was writing from that address), the new one and wait a copy of passport\n\nI duly did this and then received news that it would take THREE working days to rectify. This brings us earlies to Thursday 31\/12. Thus I missed the the 30\/12 going into next year. \n\nI start to believe they are doing this on purpose to pester me and to force me to abandon my effort. They cannot further from the truth. \n\nShame on you V.","title":"Still not happy","stars":1,"location":"ES","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=82&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-12-24","author":"zhen","text":"I have listed a hoodie, which is brand new with tag and  cover bag.

Twice I have got in touch with them and they have promised to sort it within days...as you can imagine every time nothing has happened.
