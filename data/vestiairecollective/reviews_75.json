When paying for the item, it clearly states \u00a30 on Import Duties\/Taxes which reassured me of this.  \n\nPrior to this I've even read in the FAQ on the Vestiaire Collective website that nothing will change for UK buyers buying in the UK (even if it is not through direct shipping).\n\nHowever, I received a email this morning from the courier stating I must pay \u00a3132.40 for import charges.  Baffled by this, I started spoke to a representative in their chatbox.  \n\nAt first, the representative told me they can go ahead and pay me back for the import charge once I paid it.  All I would need to do is provide proof it has been paid for.  A minute later he\/she comes back to say, 'My bad and I apologize for the confusion.'  The representative goes on to say this refund is now not possible because I did not use the direct shipping method.  This does not make sense to me because again I why would I have to pay for import taxes on an item purchased from the same country?\n\nThen, the representative goes on to tell me the \u00a3132.40 charge may be VAT which he\/she says is different from inport charges but did not seem certain and will get back to me after he\/she escalates this to a senior department.  I asked how I could follow up but the response is that I can only wait for them to contact me about this or email the support team (which I assume is would require me to explain the whole situation again to a new representative who may have to then escalate this issue to someone else.)\n\nThere is no clarity to this process.  I am very frustrated and cannot understand why I would be paying import taxes in this case.\n\n*EDIT: I was reading some of the responses VC left for other comments left on Trust Pilot.  In one line it, they state 'When you buy in the UK from a UK seller, you won't be affected by VAT even if you select an authentication service.'--- SO WHY AM I BEING AFFECTED BY VAT?","title":"UK Buyer Subjected to Import Charges\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=75&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-04","author":"Amanda Wogan","text":"I paid EU to UK import duties\/taxes on my order direct with VESTIAIRE.
