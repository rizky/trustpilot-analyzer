[{"date":"2020-11-14","author":"Victoria Diaz","text":"On Oct 6 I've sold an Acne Studios cardigan and VC does not process my payment. It's not a new situation as it has happened before.\n The buyer by mistake mentioned that there's a problem with my cardigan. Then later the buyer sent me a message that it has been a miss-understanding, that she loves the cardigan and she will keep it.\nThe buyer never sent the cardigan back to VC (as VC told me).\nThe buyer kept the cardigan, and the buyer is super happy about the purchase (the buyer told me so via message).\nI contacted VC's customer service about this payment issue and they told me \"we'll contact you in 3 days\". The never did. I HAVE MORE THAN 1 MONTH WAITING FOR MY PAYMENT. To talk to them is like talking to a robot or to a wall. Even to talk to a wall could be more rewarding since their customer service people are very arrogant making the experience very unpleasant. They made me feel like I was selling bad things (when the true shows that the buyer is very happy with the purchase).\nThis is not the only product it hasn't been paid to me.\nTo write in Trustpilot is more effective than contacting their arrogant stuff via chat as they only answer you one thing \"we'll send you an email\". It doesn't matter the question or the problem you have, the only answer you get is: \"we'll send an email\". They never do, or the mail you get from them is merely a technical description of your chat with them. No solution. My problem is genuine. VC exists thanks sellers that create content and they make everything very difficult for sellers. Yes, you can sell some items but it takes a lot of time, nerves and patience. Other secondhand platforms are far more \"human\" with sellers than VC. They seem to hate sellers.","title":"On Oct 6 I've sold an Acne Studios\u2026","stars":1,"location":"LT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=89&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-14","author":"Prada","text":"I have many negative points to share about this company. However, I only interested in sharing the crucial issues; \n\n1) VC often lied about the payment to their seller. I have experienced this more than five times. In which, they informed the seller that the payment has been made. In fact, they never did the pay-out. Usually, they will be persisting, that the seller should wait after 5 working days for the money to arrive. After that, they will inform the seller that there was an error on their system which failed the transaction. Thus, the seller needs to wait another week for VC to proceed with \u200bthe payment.  In fact, they never settle the payment. By this trick, they can delay the payment for approx. 2-3 weeks. As I can not accept their dishonest gesture any longer, last time, I was insisted on them to provide me the proof of transfer for the failed attempts. Of course, they can't provide them, quite simple; they never made the payment. \n\n2) their direct-shipping platform is very biased and at the same time very risky. It is so easy for the buyer to claims that the item does not meet the description, etc. Remember, there are also many dishonest buyers. i.e. the buyer will claim the items are not as described. By this approach, the dishonest buyer can use the item for a week or even longer. In the worst scenario, the buyer returned the item with some damages on it after they used it for free. Please note, buyers have their rights protected by its credit company, etc, for example, open a dispute in case of problems. As a seller, if VC or the buyer holds your item then the process will be more complicated. Namely, no protection. So, seller, please be aware of this as VC doesn't really protect their seller. \n\n3) I bought a Drew-Chlo\u00e9 bag. I have doubted the authentication of the bag, they are insisted that their experts were rights. The only option I have is to re-list the item. When the bag is sold at VC, they asked me to provide the receipt because they can't authenticate them. Really? so, they have sold me a counterfeit in the first place. Then, contradict their own credibility afterward. Because of this, they downgraded my status as an expert seller. Hence, the expert seller status is rather a sloppy judgment. \n\nAbove all, I am aware there are no perfect customer services, but keep spreading lies and use the customer both seller and buyer as a free sources of capital are a very disgraceful way of doing business.","title":"Absurd direct-shipping services","stars":1,"location":"DK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=89&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-15","author":"Ji","text":"FRAUDULENT COMPANY!\nI was about to check out an item and I used a $20 coupon code on the item, then all of a sudden they charge me $20 import \"fees\" they never charged before?

However, now they claim I am not entitled to free commission on my first sale due to their own slow approval process. I have contacted customer service and have heard nothing. Absolutely horrible first time experience. Seeing the amount of complaints about dodgy sellers at Vestiaire, you'd think they would try to keep new customers who are hassle free and who have a lot more great items to sell in unworn\/mint condition. But considering the absolute lack of service it seems they do not care about their customers at all. Unacceptable! They have the audacity to call me a \"valued first time customer\" when they completely ignore my complaint and expect me to continue to sell on their platform after such a horrid experience and failed customer service.\n\nEDIT: they have not resolved the issue at all and in fact have made matters worse!

I purchased a pair of pants that I was really excited for, great price and the item is not available ANYWHERE else. The seller shipped it to their warehouse during the acceptable time frame, and my order history informed me it was received by the warehouse and awaiting authentication. Two weeks went by and no updates, so I opened a chat with customer service. They told me they hadn't received the item during their 15 day time frame and the order was promptly canceled, despite my protests. I contacted the seller, she confirmed she shipped it and her info said they received it just like I had seen. I contacted customer service again to dispute the cancelation, and they informed me there was nothing they could do and I would have to wait and see if it was re-listed so I could repurchase it later on. This is totally ridiculous. I was more than willing to wait and now I might miss out on being able to purchase it at all. It sounds to me like they lost the order and are blaming the seller instead of taking responsibility for the issue and trying to resolve it with me. So disappointed and have now wasted hours of my time (and the seller's time!) trying to sort this out.
