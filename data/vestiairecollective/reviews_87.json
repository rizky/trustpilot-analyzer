She stated she had also sold another item in October and the same thing has happened and to date she has still had not received that item back. What is the point of purchasing items from this website if they do not have procedures in place to deal with their own Countries customs authorities!! It is total a lack of care and consideration not only to their buyers but also to their sellers. What is written against the order is completely untrue because the seller has sent the item but Vestiaire are doing nothing to retrieve it from their countries customs authorities. I have been in touch with Vestiaire Collective to ask why they are not retrieving this item from their customs and they sent me a generic email reply stating their delivery times and if the item does not reach them within their stated delivery time they will cancel the order and refund me.

Secondly, they formulate it in the way \u201cthey could not be sure its authentic\u201d, so if you are not sure, why are you taking money and badges like you are sure? If you are not sure, I doesnt mean you are right nor are you entitled to make moves like this.
