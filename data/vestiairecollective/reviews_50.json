[{"date":"2021-08-04","author":"Beatnik","text":"The saga continues with Vestiaire.  This is their response to me even though their website says item received. They keep asking for information about shipment when they acknowledged receipt two days after item was mailed\n \nThank you for responding.\n\nI just want to let you know that this has been coordinated to our Team of Experts and the advise is to contact the USPS drop off point to and check with them directly as the parcel has never entered the network of Fedex.\n\nYour understanding and patience on this matter is greatly appreciated.\n\nThis is my latest response:\n\nMy question below about why Vestiaire indicated received is still not been answered. I am told if item is dropped off at USPS a FedEx truck will ultimately retrieve it, that is the process in place. I though nothing of it since Vestiaire marked the item as received.  I expect because went through USPS, it may not have been properly scanned for tracking.  Still, Vestiaire showed it was received two days after shipping.  Seems Vestiaire is using this technicality and still not addressing the elephant in the room. Why was it marked received by Vestiair if not received. This is like me confirming that I received an Amazon delivery, but then saying no I did not receive it because the tracking is off. Please answer the question regarding Vestiaire marking this item received and in assessment two days after.  What are the chances that temporal with the shipment that Vestiaire will mark the item received and in assessment.  This just seems very off and fishy. The investigation should be, who marked the item received at Vestiaire, review video of day they marked the item received to see what they processed.  Has that been done?\n\nVestiaire\u2019s response on 8.5.21 to my communication above:\n\nThank you for responding.\nI am very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.\nAs much as I would love to help, this was the advise by our Team of Experts.\nThank you very much for understanding.\n\nMy response to Vestiaire on 8.5.21:\n\nCan I please get an answer to the following?\n\n1. What is the Vestiaire process for marking an item Delivered and in assessment?\n2. And, why was my item marked Delivered and in assessment on June 23rd by Vestiaire giving the impression that Vestiaire had received same?\n\nVestiaire has still not answered this which is critical to this issue. It keeps on glossing over it as though of no import.","title":"The saga continues with Vestiaire","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=50&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-08-04","author":"Lise","text":"i really wish I\u2019d tend the reviews.

They have consistently misrepresented me as a seller to customers by manipulating the sales price of my merchandise, quoting the lowest end of my negotiation rates for in-season items - that are in great, sometimes never worn, condition - to interested buyers based on the private messages I have exchanged with other members on the site. They have engaged in communications with potential buyers that I have not authorized by prompting them to drive my negotiations further down. \n\nOver a month ago, I emailed Dounia Wone, the Chief Sustainability and Inclusion Officer, and seven other key figures in the company: Meera Trivedi, Fanny Moizant, Sophie Hersan, Sylvain Andries, Patrick Herrmann, Olivier Marchteau and Vanessa Masliah, raising issues with Vestiaire\u2019s company ethics and selling integrity. I have not heard anything back. \n\nSince they have taken no action on their mistakes, I am informing other sellers of Vestiaire's underhanded tactics - and complacent attitude towards customer service. I encourage buyers to stay firm on their rates and to ignore any ill-advised guidance sent by Vestiaire\u2019s notification system. As stated in my correspondence with Vestiaire:\n\n\u201c... I write regarding an incident that occurred with your establishment, Vestiaire Collective. The matter took place on the 22nd June 2021.  Fortunately, this was brought to my attention, very kindly, by a purchaser. \n\nI understand that Vestiaire Collective seem to have a company policy of advising purchasers that sellers will be open to a specifically lower offer - with negotiations - should one put it forward. \n\nIt is clear to me that a direct approach has been endorsed by your establishment, Vestiaire Collective, to directly message prospective purchasers and advise them on how to approach a sale in order to get the best deal for them, i.e., the buyer. This has both horrified and concerned me as it seems apparent that I have been misled and misadvised. As a result, I have lost substantial income due to Vestiare's policies.\n\nI would be obliged if you could give me clarification on these policies.  I would appreciate ideas on how Vestiaire will discourage this unfortunate business practice in the future.  In the meantime, I reserve the right to take whatever actions I deem necessary to warn others and recoup lost income.\u201d","title":"A warning to all sellers using Vestiaire's platform","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=50&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-08-06","author":"A K","text":"Fakes keep being listed and sold on this platform from first time sellers via direct shipping!

The customer service agents are full of lies and always shifting blames. \n\nSelling: they paid me less commission than they the should. I listed a few items during a commission promotional period, however the system did not correctly reflect the rate for one of the items. when I inquired about the issue, one of the agent suggested that I \u201csell the item first, they will correct the commission after\u201d. However after the item was sold, they processed the wrong amount for me again. When I asked them for an explanation they lied and said that the promotion never happened, despite all the proofs I had supplied. \n\nBuyer: I purchased an item from the platform. 3 weeks after making a payment, there was still no updates. I chatted with a customer service agent who advised that the item had not been shipped by the seller. So I decided to cancel the order which he agreed to process within 24h. The next day VC had the seller of the item contact me directly and beg me not to cancel the order, because apparently VC had some problem with the shipping code which caused the shipment delay. Another proof that VC customer service is full of lies and they had no honor or integrity when it comes to running a business. \n\nFor the level of commission they charge (or overcharge), this business is a huge scam, there\u2019s a long period of time when they are in possession of both the goods and the full payment and they apparently misuse this power to maximize every little profit.

I have tried to sell an item on the website and decided against it when I saw how much commission was taken. There are many other places that can be used so this is not my main issue with VC. As a Canadian this website is extremely frustrating to navigate when it comes to duties, taxes, and authenticity fees. The pricing is inconsistent and the explanations even less informative. I cannot complain about customer services as I felt they responded in a timely manner. I am a very savvy consumer and I do my due diligence when buying or selling items. On the VC website you will find items at reasonable prices until you checkout. EXAMPLE: (ref: 16255704) Burberry shirt priced at $343.13 CAD with authentication at 10 CAD plus 26.24 shipment\/insurance and $137 dollars in VAT taxes (duties). The shirt ends up being over 500 dollars Canadian. This shirt is coming directly from VC, so why am I paying 10 dollars to authenticate it? Is VC suggesting that they hold merchandise in their warehouse that could be counterfeit? If you have the item onsite does that not suggest that it has already been authenticated? Why am I paying for this again? Something seems a miss here. I have shopped at many luxury websites and find VC to have the most outrages taxes, given that they are a large coropration that has many perks and deals when it comes to brokerage fees. There are many great gems you can find on the site, but maybe they need to change their model and perhaps even include payment friendly choices such as Afterpay or Paybright, as many other consignment shops do.
