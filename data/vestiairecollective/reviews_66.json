I contacted Vestiaire and it turned out they knew about the issue but did not advertise it anywhere on the app and still let the sale to go ahead. They advised me I cancelled the sale, which costed me a badge of trusted seller (therefore loosing visibility and trustworthiness) and there was no reimbursement from VC.\nRecently, VC introduced a new commission model which saved sellers some money. I sold two items and accepted low offers for these as I thought I was under new commission model. Wrong. Turns out all items listed previously were under the old, more expensive commission model. I contacted VC and once again no reimbursement.\nI\u2019ll ship my newest sale, will wait for the payment and then will most probably close my account.

Shipping was done from Switzerland. Both items arrived after 2-3d in Paris, cleared customs and waiting to be picked up by VC. It never happened. \n\n1 item was sent back to me after nearly 2 months, with the reason that VC refused to accept the items. \n\nI have been with the customer service on several chats, over several days\/weeks. \n\nReason #1: we did not receive it, because you need to pay for VAT, which is the Buyers obligation. \nMy Answer: no, i dont need to pay it. the VAT is added to the final invoice of the item, hence it was already paid. \n\nReason #2: we did not receive it, because we had a system error, and were unable to accept it. \n\nReason #3: we did not receive it, because you did not attach the label. \nAnswer: i received back one item, label correctly attached, all visible - I cant even make it up, because the french & swiss post attached other labels to it. \n\nReason #4: we did not receive it, because ....\nAnswer: please just be honest with your seller.\n\nThe support of the customer service goes as far as: you need to check yourself with the delivery company where your item is and what the problem is. \n\nI was connected to approx. 4 different people at Customer Service - they dont understand the billing and taxing - one of them even told me, that I have to pay for the VATs, and that the Buyer did not pay for the VAT, hence the Officials are still waiting for the Buyer to pay it. makes no sense.\n\nSince both my items got shipped on time, got cleared by the customs  (within 3days!!!), and waited for VC to be picked up\/taken over in less than a week, i can simply not accept that it was either the Buyers or Sellers fault, that they were not picked up by VC. The only explanation I accept is, that they had a system error and were unable to receive it.\n\nAfter many worrisome weeks, and a financial loss (im paying for shipping costs), I decided to pull all my items from VC and find another trustful company. I also had sold another item in the meantime, but decided to stop it since VC doesnt accept my items. \n\nPS: I also bought a pink coat - it was orange - and it got accepted by VC.","title":"VC Customer Service does not help you","stars":1,"location":"CH","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=66&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-03-22","author":"Theona Cioc\u00eerlan","text":"One star is too much for this company.

Top management may flash a green climate agenda. However they forget that ethics and legality is also important to create a sustainable business. An example of their misleading advertising is their Golden Voucher Competition where they invited members, including me, to list items for sale. A prize of 1000 Euro was at stake (this amount was flashed in other big currencies so it looked like there were several prizes, when in fact there was only one). After listing several items it was brought to my attention that only French residents could join the competition to win. So why did VC invite me, I am not a French resident? To boozt sale, naturally. A day went on and a growing number of members were dissatisfied. VC finally admitted it was a mistake. A bit later VC mailed me I could not join the competition due to my account being in DKK. Only accounts in Euro, GBP and other large currencies were eligible. However, 24\/7 any member can adjust their account to any of these currencies. It takes under one minute. So this new explanation from VC is ridiculous and the thinnest argument north of the Alps! Several attempts to get an explanation, or even proper excuse, from VC has been in vain. Customer service has become more and more robotized over the last year. My patience is worn out. I could name numerous other cases of VC laissez faire attitude, lies and hiding their head in the bush like an ostrich.
