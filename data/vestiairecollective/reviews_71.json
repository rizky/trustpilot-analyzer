Last week I received an email saying that I needed to update my banking information as per their new payment system which would shorten the time that the sellers need to wait before getting paid, how nice! Well, I did it right away and then sold my bag and was told that my payment would go through today on feb 24th. Well then at literally 3am this morning I got an email saying that \u201coh no we can\u2019t pay you, you also need to verify your identity and your address by uploading your passport pic and your utility bill\u201d - I did it right away but was feeling extremely annoyed because why couldn\u2019t you ask me to do all of these last week when I was asked to verify my banking information?????? How convenient it is that on the day that I am supposed to get paid I was asked to provide additional documents which could take up to FOUR business days to be verified according to VC??? I\u2019ll remove this review if VC indeed ends up verifying my identity and paying me today! Otherwise it\u2019s just a scam - holding my funds longer than necessary. Honestly I would not use VC if I wasn\u2019t living in Europe. Before I moved to Europe, I was using the RealReal, must faster, much more intuitive and more quality buyers who would not back out on deals. I would switch to another platform as soon as there is a better one coming out in Europe. On VC it\u2019s full of garbage buyers who make offers and don\u2019t go through with the payment after - what ends up happening is as a seller toh are tide up in that offer for more than 24 hours without being able to void the offer or get out. Please also fix that and make buyers put down a deposit before they can start making offers. The user interface also sucks, laggy as hell. If you are in North America, stick to the RealReal, don\u2019t waste your time on VC.","title":"There\u2019s always something wrong in the VC land","stars":1,"location":"IT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=71&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-24","author":"Ashleigh Brown","text":"I sold a scarf on Vestiaire and used their prepaid postage to mail it from my local post office.  They claimed to have never received it, and never informed me\/sent a notification that the sale did not go through because they never received the scarf.  The scarf was never returned to me, so with no notification from Vestiaire, I assumed that the sale went through.  When I realized that I still hadn't received payment months later, I made a formal complaint.  But their customer service representative said they'd only consider a refund if I composed a HANDWRITTEN LETTER OF HONOUR to explain the situation.  Then I had to take a photo of it and forward it to their customer service.  The customer service rep then said they couldn't reimburse me because my request was outside the limitation time, and refused to pay me the value of the scarf.  The scarf was under \u00a3200 which is nothing for a company of this size.  Vestiaire, if you're going to create a secure postage system, maybe pay for better class postage or tracking, or be ready to pay your customers when things get lost.  Not to mention for the 20% fee you charge, you should do better.  \n\nOh, and when I tried to explain to a new customer that I was removing my items from Vestiaire as we were in a dispute, they deleted my comment (because they review everything you say so that it only benefits them).

Fine, these things happen to the best of us sometimes and I was planning to send this item to the original brand for investigation as there are many events described here when authentic items were declared non-compliant, even those which were previously bought through\u00a0VC.\nI paid the processing and postage fee so that the item could be shipped back to me. After it arrived in my country, I received a message from DHL that my shipment has outstanding\u00a0tax to be paid. This is clearly nonsense as this was MY ITEM which was returned back to me which meant Vestiaire Collective did a false customs declaration which incurred tax charges which by law I am not obliged to pay as I am receiving an item back which belongs to me.\nI contacted VC support for clarification and fixing of this issue. The responses I received from CS were the following:\n- \"we can't pay shipping for you\" (nonsense, I paid the shipping cost)\n- \"we can't pay the tax as the shipment is not insured\" (no comments on this)\nNo one even tried to understand the actual problem until someone from chat support wrote that yes, this is clearly VC's mistake, asked me to pay the tax and promised to reimburse me.\nI paid the tax (over 50 bucks ON MY OWN ITEM) and sent it to VC.After a few\u00a0days I received a message saying that reimbursement is not possible and \"they hope I understand\". No, I don't.\nI tried to contact DHL to get a refund for the tax since I've got all the proof that the shipment was a return. DHL representative informed me that I was lucky I paid the tax in time to get my item back because the shipper - Vestiaire Collective - INFORMED THEM TO DESTROY THE SHIPMENT when they tried to contact them to clarify the customs declaration issue. Again, VS kept insisting they did not give such an instruction despite the fact that I showed them a screenshot from that particular email from DHL. When I asked whether they are implying DHL is lying, no one responded to me.\n\nHaving said that, I would like to summarize:\n1) customer support does not even try to understand the issue. They don't even answer the question you are asking, very often their response does not even correspond to what you've asked.\n2) feeding false information, taking back their own promises which were set in writing.\n3) failing to take responsibility for their screw ups.\nShame.","title":"Sell at your own risk.","stars":1,"location":"SG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=71&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-25","author":"Matt","text":"Item got stuck in customs despite being direct shipping and all taxes paid.
