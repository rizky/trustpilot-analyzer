You can google Chronopost and you will definitely understand my thought. When the parcel arrived HK, it mentioned that my phone number was not provided so the parcel was on hold...

I kept chasing after them again, using live chat! Luckily, one of the customer service representatives decided to escalate my issue (which is very rare from the review here) and she even called me once to assure that VC would treat the issue seriously. She also sent me email and always replied in a few hours (so I didnt have to wait for another \u2018expert\u2019 and reply in 2-3days..) \n\nAfter a few days, a correct hyperlink to track my parcel was provided.

I made a listing for an authentic Celine bag which had been dyed black. I highlighted this in the description and on the photos that show the serial number tag as still being pink leather. The listing was verified and approved. The bag sold on the 17\/01\/21 and the buyer chose to get the bag authenticated, which is fair. The bag arrived at the vestiare headquarters on the 22\/01\/21, so four days later (Dublin - Paris with DHL). On the 26\/01\/21 it was marked non-compliant, and that was the last I heard. The following week I had to get in touch with them to find out what the story was. They claimed it didn't match the description (very untrue) and they also marked it as a failed sale and docked my seller rating to 62%. To add to that I then again (!!!)  had to get in touch to ask when will I get my bag back - The vague response (on the 3\/02\/21) after the chat was 'Thank you for letting us know you'd like your bag back (seriously??)and that the bag would be shipped back 'in a few days' and that tracking will follow. On the 8\/02\/21 the bag still hadn't been shipped back. I once again got in touch and was told it would take 3 working days to post the bag back. At this point they have had my item (after it was marked non-compliant) for a solid two weeks and if I hadn't got in touch they wouldn't even have bothered to send me my Celine trio back. I cannot believe the have such awful protocols to deal with non-compliant items given the whole platform only exists because sellers and willing to list item son there (I personally will continue to stick with DEPOP where the service is good and the commission isn't as ridiculously high as Vestiare). This review is from a sellers point of view but I can say that the buying process isn't particularly smooth sailing either - a direct result of the zero communication possible between sellers and buyers.
