Now it is being sent back to the seller to inevitably be sold to someone else. When I explained to Customer Service that it should really be redelivered instead of cancelled (especially since this was the fault of VC not me), both customer service assistants\u201d just repeated the same words again and again )in very poor English) and left the chat before I was finished chatting to them. Of all the customer service experiences I have had, this is the first time I have had customer service exit the chat because they just didn\u2019t feel like helping. They said I had to sign up (at extra charge) to Premium and then I can see in advance when it goes on sale - but not even this guarantees I get my item.

Now they are asking for a photo id of mine and a handwritten statement, stating that I didn't receive the shipment. I had the following question:\n1. I ordered my stuff from VC as an identity of VC customer, an identity as an email address, why when it goes to tracking my shipment, I have to provide my real identity behind this email address?\n2. How will they handle my photo id and other data after they process my complaint?\n\nAnyway, terrible service up until now, and if you google VC or go to Youtube, you will also see a lot of negative reviews.

After it, I started to search for company info and read reviews from here. They have an ashamed reputation. If I had read it before, I would not require their services.

One of the instructions was to download a label, print and stick it on the parcel. \nBut, I did not expect they would ask me to download a label that does not correspond with my info.  Yes, my name was on it, but when I called DHL to give updates, they said the tracking number that I have  (a number that was on the label given by VC) did not correspond with my details; it shows info from another country, another sender... How could it happen? Probably it was a mistake from VC that sent me the wrong label... They sold the bag, now they have cancelled it, and I still have no updates about my Chanel bag. \nIf I do not receive it soon, I will go to court to sort that issue legally. \nMy advice is to search or ask for more info about a company that you are dealing with, especially with a company that sells luxury items but did not offer the support that we all expected to have.","title":"VC gave me the wrong label to print - the parcel is LOST","stars":1,"location":"IE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=35&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-11","author":"CS","text":"Lie after lie after lie !!!!!!!
