These came with a prescription lens, were wider than described and with a bent arm. None of these issues were advised in the listing. I even took the lenses to an optician who verified the issues. Vestiaires response was initially \" after investigation, we do not see an issue'. My further emails quoting their own terms that have been breached have all been ignored. I have phoned three times and either had the phone put down or promised a call back which has not been forthcoming. Ebay has a better mediation policy and buyer protection. I have bought 3 items from them - 2 I have had issues with (not as advertised). Neither have been resolved. If you want buyer confidence do not use this site.

They also said that they will contact the seller about this issue.\n\nMagically the day after I made the complain 5-6 new pictures were added to the sellers bag add!! When I saw this my heart dropped, since I knew that my changes of getting my money back were low, since they would automatically believe this \u201dTrusted Seller\u201d.\nI was also suprised that the authentification team passed a bag that had s super strong cigarette smell, so be very avare that the authentification team will pass bags that have digusting stink.\n\nAt one point I was promised that I will receive a full refund but what happened is that the bag went trought another authentification process and it passed again (off course since they compared the pictures with the new set of pictures that the seller had!) everything was ok from VC point of view. Now I\u2019m 750\u20ac poorer and stuck with a bag that smells like cigarettes.\n\nI will not buy\/sell anything throught VC since I don\u2019t trust their processes and I don\u2019t believe that they truly care about customers.

VC team when checking them pointed out that the heels have signs of wear providing one photo with some marks - looking like dirt, offering to discount an item by \u00a313 if I still wanted them. Trusting them that marks presented on photos are accurate I accepted the offer. Heels arrived and they are brand new with no signs of wear BUT with DEFECTS. Marks assumed to be wear are in fact discolouration - heels caught dye from something. Any attempt to remove the dye results in paint coming off - they already arrived with white patches with no paint. Heels also came with dent sole and only one dust bag - YSL provides 2 dust bags, one is not big enough to fit both shoes. I contacted then VC both on a chat and by email and they don\u2019t think they\u2019re at fault. \u00a313 was also provided in a form of voucher to use a on VC website and not a refund, it does not compensate anything. It seems like misadverting the item is completely fine. To fix the heels and repaint them costs a lot of money, and additional time and effort. On the photos used by the listing heels seem to be in a perfect condition. On the only photo provided by VC with caption \u201cwear\u201d one can see few dirt marks. Upon arrival it\u2019s clear they\u2019re defected, and dark discolouration marks are all over the heels. Paying over \u00a3200 for misadvertised item is a SCAM. There was no mention of white patches with no paint, discolouration marks or dent sole.\n\nI received a response from VC asking for a quote from shoe repair. I spent multiple hours to look for open shoe repair in the middle of pandemic. They confirmed what I stated - marks are not dirt from wear but black dye and heels are defected. I\u2019ve send them a quote multiple times, it\u2019s been 6 weeks since sending it the first time and they never replied. I opened PayPal dispute and I\u2019m supposed to return these shoes, out of my own pocket, so now I have to spend my own \u00a330 just to return it. I will of course return them. The amount of time I wasted is shocking and now I\u2019ll be losing money.\nI\u2019ve been buying online for 10 years now and never have I ever came across a company that treats people like this.\n\nNext pair of YSL shoes came with a scratch, marks and dirty sole covered in glue, with only one dust bag instead of two. It\u2019s a joke.\n\nDon\u2019t buy anything from them because they don\u2019t check items properly and then claim it\u2019s not their responsibility to solve a problem. If you do have problems with them ask PayPal to step in or your bank for chargeback as their customer service is useless.","title":"Absolutely the worst company there is and appalling customer service","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=61&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-29","author":"Sp Eedy","text":"I have sold item over Vestiaire Collective, since I am outside of Eu I had to pay shipping, they are not covering.

Over twenty times I contacted VC to solve the problem and 55 days later they didn't do anything about it. When I asked them should I forward invoice to French customs they categorically banned me to do that and confirmed to wait for their \"Expert Team\" to solve the problem.
