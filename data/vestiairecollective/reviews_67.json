I sold the sneakers and had the sneakers go through another authentication. which failed and were confirmed FAKE.  Upon closer inspection and lots of internet research, I could then see that they were indeed fake.  I also checked the seller on VC \"kdjluxe\" who apparently operates a bogus business in France and also has an Instagram account \"kdj_luxe\" which states that they are no longer doing on business on PayPal because too many people were complaining about them.  They instead want a direct bank transfer and also do not do returns or provide refunds (fishy).  They also have a bogus website, yet have been in \"business\" for nearly a year.  The fact that VC has been conned by this seller is disturbing and even more disappointing that I have lost trust in them (I am a seller and was a buyer).

After ordering them for about $2000 each, they were never delivered, seller was unresponsive, and eventually I got a refund for 90% of the amount I paid.  So each purchase cost me $200, for nothing.  And they are still listed on the site for sale!  So basically, they list fake products and make $200 for each sale of fake products.\nThe 3rd product I ordered is still waiting for delivery.  And I realized they charge $800 for customs duty.  When I queried them on this, because customs duty should only be $100, they said it was non-negotiable.  So basically, whatever price you see the item for sale on the website, they add an additional 30% markup when you try to buy it, and make it a \"customs fee\".

It has been getting worse and worse and by now it got to the point where it is unbearable.\nMy 5 cents to the rest who gave you 1 star: totally perfect authentic items are getting refused for no good reason, and what is funny, some of them had original brand documents. Still CS said \"oh they were found to be fake\".\nReally?! So I am asking a question: is Vestiaire Collective trying to say that Chanel themselves accepted item for repair, fixed it, issued documents and somehow while physically handling the item they did not notice the item is fake? Such incompetent Chanel they are. \nAnd is Vestiaire Collective claiming such an enormous level of expertise which is better than the original brand by spotting a fake in the photo in a glimpse of an eye? Is that right? \nMy 9(!) items were refused within 5 minutes: I even took screenshot from my mailbox. If you try to contact CS, they will send you a disgusting generic response saying \"our experts are working very hard\" and blah blah blah. That really does not look like working very hard. Each listing had 12-13 crisp clear photos together with super close up pics of the brand marks, detailed descriptions, items were in like new condition etc. How anyone could thoroughly check these in this timeframe?\nApparently not, as they did not even bother to check photos of the original documents supplied in the listings, just hit refuse button. And yes, if I could share all the proof here, I would.\nHow you treat your clients, Vestiaire, is atrocious. Sellers are also your clients, BTW, in case you missed that part.\nThe website is so full of obvious fakes while genuine items are getting refused by \"experts\". What. On. Earth.\nSHAME ON YOU.\nWishing someone started a competitor project with the same system which is actually working while Vestiaire can continue to enjoy refusing authentic items and approving and authenticating fakes.","title":"Experts?
