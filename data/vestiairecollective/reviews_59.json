Baring in mind the description of the bag was very good condition virtually no signs of wear. When I opened the box Immediately I saw that the clasp was broken along with the flap of the bag was very badly stained and deep scratches around the bag. Vestiaire is very bad to get anyone to speak to I sent numerous emails I had to send pictures of the state of the bag then send it back for inspection. After 2 days Vestiaire confirmed the bag did not match the sellers discription\nand said I would receive a refund but no apology or acknowledgment that it should never have had a label on the bag to claim it had been inspected.\nI had to send e mails every day for a week to get them to pay me my refund it was extremely stressful.\nVestiaire even sent me notifications that the bag had come back into stock but this time it was down graded \nto fair condition and they listed all that was wrong with the bag and that some of the bag had not got Chanel parts to it. \nMy advice to others who are thinking of purchasing anything from this site don\u2019t they are not professional and very much living on past reputation.","title":"Vestiaire not inspecting the merchandise","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=59&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-05-12","author":"Ryan","text":"I bought an item and went through so-called Vestiaire Collective check (which is a paid service).

These guys don't know how to authenticate many brands listed on the site. \n\n- I've turned off the offers function many months now since most of them are NOT binding at all-- when you're operating with this system, one or two fall throughs are natural. When MOST of the offers I've accepted don't turn into buys, it becomes a nuisance to everyday life. Why can't VC lock in negotiations??\n\n- Shipping cost is a major turn off. I wouldn't buy unless the item is that enticing\n\n- VC is launching promo campaigns that don't exist! Every now and then I'm getting pop ups telling me to list a few items in return for a $xxx voucher. I then try to list a couple of things and there is no follow up on this voucher business-- there was a campaign recently that sellers could list certain brands commission free, it turns out that this is only a regional promo not applicable to certain countries. Where is the clarity in these campaigns? \n- Another annoying thing is frequent alerts asking me to reduce my price on a certain item to xxx to \"increasing my chance of selling by 50%\". Define 50%. I've always been puzzled by what algorithmic measures are taken once I take this action. Again, the lack of clarity gives me suspicion that this is all just false claims.\n\n- There really are better platforms to use without all the hassle and frustrations-- did I mention the lack of customer service? Don't even go there. \n\nLooking forward to my last pay so that I can de-list everything from VC and finally delete my account.","title":"One year selling on VC and deleting this app.","stars":1,"location":"HK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=59&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-05-14","author":"LK","text":"As a long time customer of VC, my latest purchase was absolutely not as described.

After 5 days when I wore the jacket, I noticed that in the back the leather was scratched and the givenchy label (inside) was poorly re-stitched. I informed vestiaire immediately and uploaded pics and they told me that they can do nothing about it since the 72hours went by. The jacket had no other labels (size,washing instructions,serial number) so it was obviously fake. Their customer service never helps and they just sent automated messages!

I sold item number 14960881 on 26.04.2021 and shipped it to the buyer on 28.04.2021. The buyer requested that the item is delivered to a DHL facility in France, where it is convenient for her to pick it up. The item has been available for collection at that facility since 29.04 and the buyer has still not collected it. I contacted customer support 4 times already to request that they contact the buyer to pick up the item, because I cannot be paid for the sale otherwise. I have been waiting for almost 20 days now and the buyer has still not collected her item. I contacted customer support today as well, to request resolution and support. I have fully fulfilled my contractual obligations and I have made the item available for collection to the buyer, which I explained to customer support. However I received a response saying that there is basically nothing they can do and if the buyer contacts them to request that the sale is cancelled they will refund her and return the item to me, since she has not picked it up yet. This is completely unfair towards me as a seller and there is clearly zero seller protection while selling on Vestiaire Collective. They are making me wait for 20 days for the buyer to collect her item and now if she decides she does not want it anymore they will cancel the sale, which is completely unfair towards me as a seller. In this timeframe of 20 days I could have sold the item to another buyer, but Vestiaire Collective is taking away this opportunity from me, as the item is stuck in a DHL facility waiting to be picked up and at the same time Vestiaire Collective's customer support is refusing to pay me for my sale and they are telling me that I should simply wait for an unknown period of time....\n\nCompletely unfair attitude towards sellers, extremely poor customer support that is 70% executed by automated messages instead of actual responses. \n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend selling through Vestiaire Collective as they clearly have zero interest in protecting the sellers on the platform. Nevertheless they charge HUGE commissions from sellers and in return sellers do not even get minimum protection...\n\nI hope my issue to be resolved in the end and to be fully paid for me sale, so that next time I can leave a positive review for Vestiaire Collective.","title":"Zero seller protection on Vestiaire Collective","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=59&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-05-16","author":"Ivy T","text":"Only if I could have given no Stars.
