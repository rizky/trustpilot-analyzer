After that, I tried again to purchase something, after more then a week from the purchase moment, I was waiting for them to finish with the authentication process and send the item to me. Without letting me know, I\u2019ve seen on the App, that they are giving me a refund, again, without no explanation. I\u2019ve tried to communicate with 2 different persons from Vestiaire via Email, and one of then clearly doesn\u2019t now anything, she was keep addressing me like I was the seller not the buyer, even if I explained her the situation and every question that I had she was telling that she is not able to give me a response, and I have to wait three days for an actual response. The other person that I\u2019ve communicate with via Email, after responding me only one time, he stoped. Even If I\u2019ve sent him 2 more emails. Basically they told me that the seller send an empty package to them, and they without letting me know about the situation, are keep telling me that they will give me a refund, but now I am a little bit worried because almost 5 days have passed and I don\u2019t see the refund in my bank account. And this is not all, the seller, after he sent the empty package to Vestiaire, he has the same product for sale now, again, under the same name with the same pictures, how is this possible? This is outrageous, I don\u2019t understand how they are allowing this person to sell the same product. I am sick of this!

Now I am having another issue with an item that I ordered about two months ago and that never arrived. I have contacted them three times about this issue and never got any answer.

But this is not the case! Before shipping the article to VC the seller may change his mind anytime and tell VC that the item \"is not available anymore\". This is part of the business model, as VC does not sanction this behaviour and also offers the seller a delay of 7 days to change her\/his mind (officially called \"ship\") before sending a reminder. After another 7 days of being able to sell the product elsewhere, the transaction is cancelled and you get a refund and a voucher. This happened twice within a few months and the \"support\" says that this is fully ok.\nSo be aware: you only bought an item if you hold the parcel in your hands.\n\nAnother drawback is the amount of fake (inactive) sellers and fake (unavailable) items. Probably because a huge number of articles and members seems to be attractive. Of course inactive members happen with any website, but there is no \"cleanup\" happening at VC. VC does not remove anything if the seller does not remove it. So if the seller is inactive the item stays there as \"available\" forever. The \"support\" says they are not allowed to remove anything. But they could, if they wanted. Many other second hand websites have an automatic termination date for the articles. And it would be easy to send a reminder to the seller after 6 months, that they need to confirm that the item or the seller is still available. As I said, it would be easy if VC wanted. But they don't want so there are a lot of dummy articles.\nKeep that in mind before you fall in love with a new piece.","title":"Be careful!","stars":1,"location":"DE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=98&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-08","author":"Customer","text":"What is going on? \n\nI really liked your revamp of the service and for a while things seem to be going great, sales picked up, but now it is really downhill. Even when correct sizes are put in, something in the system seems to have flaws and lists them often as other sizes. So I have to really check everything that is listed and often contact you to make corrections. Contacting you via chat is at best frustrating, but via eMail you usually get no response and nothing happens, at chat, somebody is distinctively disinterested, they often have no idea, it takes about 45 minutes to have the size of an item changed, the size that I gave in correctly in the 1st place.\nYour app is plainly a horror show, it crashed my iPad and I had to completely reinstall everything, I am not going to use that anymore, so I rely on the webpage, now the issues start.... Sometimes the webpage refuses to upload pictures or save the description, on my best day, I tried 5 different browsers and 3 different computers. Your webchat told me it must be my cookies (seriously???) I tried to explain that it is an IT problem, he told me must be my cookies. Is that the standard reply for everything?\nNext thing price gouging, I believe it is the system making simply totally crazy price suggestions with \"Trust us, we know\" - so far what you are doing isn't super trustworthy. Valentino Garavani shoes that I have worn once, no, I am not going to sell them for the price of a no name shoe and if I would see them for your suggested price, I would think \"too good to be true, there must be a hitch\"\n\nNow you have taken away the option to see what else a seller is selling, where you can see all the items they have listed, so far that is actually how I found most of the items I bought, one item of a seller caught my eye, it wasn't 100% my thing, so I checked what else they had and often bought something else as our tastes obviously were compatible. Since that is gone, my sales have dramatically slowed down, I assume that is what others also do and now they don't find my items anymore.\n\nI quite like the fact that i can switch off offers, as usually the offers people make are often ridiculous, it doesn't stop people from making comments under the items. Not to mention all the men with different \"preferences\" who are on the site and ask for pictures of how women should pose for them, especially when it comes to shoes.\n\nI thought you were really going in a good direction when you changed the business model, but that didn't take long. Lately there is also the issue of somebody on your end asking for more pictures, without saying which pictures and you already have 10 uploaded, then you dress the mannequin again (considerable time) take pictures again, upload, and then somebody decides it is rejected with totally obscure reasons of it not being in very good or good condition (it was new with tags for the record) - I decided to put it to the test and asked a friend to put it up on hers, and oddly enough the same item was accepted straight away.\n\nI hope you are reading those quite valid issues, which a lot of people share, as there is a lot of talk on internet boards about it and don't just give me the usual copy and paste reply with \"thank you for leaving a review\" - I would love it if you could go back to the service you had about a year ago, where things moved smoothly and where it was possible to get a little bit of money for an item that was very very expensive. Try to see it from the side of us who sell our items, if I can afford to buy a dress, a bag or shoes that cost me about 1K, I am not going to spend about an hour (including taking the pictures, description, measurements, struggling with your webpage) to sell it for a return of 20 or 50. I was quite loyal to you, but now started using other sites as well and often list there for higher and sell a lot faster.\n\nEdited to add: Why do you ask to list the pictures in a certain order of view, when your system then just puts them up randomly?","title":"What is going on","stars":2,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=98&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-08","author":"Julie w","text":"Can I just say as someone who hasn't sold or bought the reviews are really bad may I suggest a MASSIVE SHAKE UP....As I really want to be a seller","title":"Can I just say as someone who hasn't\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=98&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-08","author":"Adelina","text":"I sold an article through vestiaire collective some days ago ( ref. 11448173).

Also money is gone for at least 5-14days until one gets refunded. If seller refuses to ship, the deal is over. One receives 15\u20ac for the next purchase even if the amount of purchase has been more then 5000\u20ac. The fees for credit card use are up on the buyer. If something does not match the description the buyer does not even receive anything at all. Even for amounts about 10000\u20ac. Really unpleasant way of dealing!\nPurchased an Herm\u00e8s bag for about 10k \"very good condition\" - arrived broken!!! \nTook about a month to sort this out!\nIn the end VC took it back, set it online again and sold it for 1500\u20ac less... Before there was no negotiation possible, also no goodies for the next purchase and no covering for any credit card fees.\nMoney was returned after they uploaded the bag again!!! Unbelievable!!!\n\nThis week I purchased another bag and paid straight away. Money was booked the next day. 5 days later, after 2 reminders for the seller to ship the item, the seller cancelled the deal! I have received 15\u20ac for and over 5k purchase. That is it!!! Unbelievable!!!\n\nA lot of items do not match the description. Louboutins have been sold as \"very good condition\" even tough they have been fixed with clue buy a shoemaker...  not mentioned or shown in the offer - took me 3 weeks to figure that out and 3 times of shipping back and forth!\n\nClothing sold as \"very good conditon\" showing spots, loosen threads, open seewing lines and so on! - not mentioned or shown in the offer!\n\nBags sold as \"very good or good condition\" damaged, showing spots and so on - not mentioned or shown in the offer!\n\nIf items do not fit or you do not like them you can reupload them straight away \"without fees\" which is not true, one always has to pay a certain amount to VC for the \"service\". If you want to upload it as a new offer they often refuse or ask for bills. Therefore lately I asked them every time What is the problem\/ Is it fake? Because I had the proof that I purchased it on VC they took it back for checking a second time. Refunded the money to me and reuploaded the item without any notification for me. When I asked they told me it is original of course... Still a strange way of dealing and not very trustworthy. Especially tough there are a lot of feedbacks online telling about fakes sold on VC.\n\nAnyway it is really dissapointing, takes a lot of time and it is always a big Drama!!!\nAnd it happens rarely that everything works fine or even just acceptable... \n\nAs buying Herm\u00e8s bags at Herm\u00e8s is not a fairytale just as they keep telling one of course keeps an eye on second hand sellers. \nUnfortunately a lot of fake Herm\u00e8s bags are uploaded for sale on Vestiaire Collective, even tough one can already spot they are fake. Same happens with other brands - offered as original, but obviously are not. \n\nVC takes 30% fees from the seller and another fee from the buyer to provide the best service. Unfortunately the service is really really bad and highly overpaid. \n\nCustomer Service always keeps telling about there rules... I do not see there rules as fair or helpfull. Also rarely they can help, plus it takes a lot of time to find solutions. \n\nNot recommendable!","title":"My experience from purchasing on VC","stars":1,"location":"DE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=98&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-12","author":"LaVerne","text":"This company is the absolute worst in customer service and has an \u201cF\u201d rating with the BBB, the lowest possible rating you can receive.
