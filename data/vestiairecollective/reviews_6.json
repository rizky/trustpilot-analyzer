However, the recent order was unexpectedly cancelled by Vestiaire saying: \"Our authentication team have carefully examined your item, described as Sac bandouli\u00e8re GG Marmont Flap en cuir Gucci ref: 22245053. Unfortunately, in applying the criteria involved in this process, we have been unable to verify its authenticity. We are therefore cancelling the sale.\"\n\nUnfortunately they are not clear as to exactly why this bag was not deemed complaint. What criteria are they even using? I had to contact customer service for clarification and was told by a Rascelle A., \"It is declared not authentic that is why the sale got cancelled.\" Oh really, thanks for the reiteration of the vague e-mail I already received, Rascelle. Which so-called \"expert\" authenticator deemed my previously sold brand new Gucci bag as \"compliant\" and this one as \"inauthentic\"? What wildly inaccurate and arbitrary authentication methods are Vestiaire even using? When I asked more questions the customer service rep simply ended the chat. At least tell me before you go EXACTLY what was deemed false and inauthentic about this bag and not some vague blanket term. \n\nThe two Gucci Marmont bags are from the exact same places and are both authentic. Unfortunately I am now forced to pay \u20ac12 to have my item sent back to me, which is even more frustrating knowing without a doubt that my item is absolutely authentic and should have been deemed complaint if the so-called authentication team out in France knew anything about authenticating Gucci bags. This tells me that Vestiaire's authentication team is not at all careful or conscientious when authenticating items as they would like buyers and sellers to believe. \n\nThis recent episode has seriously eroded my trust in Vestiaire Collective and my trust in their authentication team. If they can simply judge authentic items as inauthentic, I have my doubts that they are experts in authentication at all and are really just random amateurs posing as experts.","title":"Vestiaire Collective's Authentication Team is Garbage","stars":1,"location":"IT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=6&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-14","author":"Ruddi Boy","text":"Absolutely scam company, deleted my account for nothing.","title":"Absolutely scam company","stars":1,"location":"ES","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=6&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-14","author":"Kimberley Denson","text":"I hate writing bad reviews but this is yet another one.  I purchased in January, was asked by the seller of the bag if they could ship it to be verified in march.  I said OK because I wasn't in a rush.  So I got word it was shipped, verified, but it had issues.  OK, well there was some scratching which wasn't disclosed by the seller.  we had a talk and I was like hmmm...ok.  its probably not that big of a deal right?\nwell maybe\n\nAnyway Vestiaire supposedly shipped the package March 14, 2022.  And, they kindly provided a fedex shipping tracking number.\nOK so I figure give 10 days because of covid and all.\nI contacted their customer service on 4\/2\/2022 because the tracking information changed and I could no longer see any information.  \n\nWhen I asked about the package they basically told me I needed to provide a driver's license to prove who I was.\n\nUh, no.  I have an account, I sent the info from my account, you can post it to my account page.  \n\nSo today is 4\/14\/22  I said enough and contacted fedex myself because these folks are not being helpful.\n \nI found out from FedEx mind you, that the package that they were to send to me was an empty package.\n\nEmpty.\n\nWhat I find interesting is that she never said the package was damaged because I asked.  She said \"It was empty\".\n\n\nFor those who packages are in so called limbo and haven't been delivered in weeks, take some time and contact whomever is shipping.  \n\nThe customer service portion of all this;  they need to do better.  They had the nerve to ask for a driver's license to track  this package.  Uh no  that info is dead to rights in my account page. And even fedex was like, we don't need that information.  So if you get anyone asking, no, they don't need that.  All they need is the tracking number.\n\nThis company has proven themselves to not be trustworthy.\n\nUpdate:  Now they're harassing the crap out of me, unbelievable.  Being bombarded with the daily emails.  I didn't lose the package, the package never made it to my house.  why they aren't following up with FedEx is beyond me.\n\n1.  They have the tracking number.  Which is the same tracking number they sent to me in email, the same one thats on my account.\n\n2. Shipper (FedEx) validated they got the box and it was empty.\n\n3. Shipper (FedEx) validated they don't send empty boxes and that the box never shipped to me, didn't ship to my neighbors.\n\n3. Shipper(FedEx) validated that Vestiaire should contact them to file the claim not contact me.\n\n4. Shipper(FedEx) is willing to show them the actual empty box.\n\nEscalated to Paypal to get my money back.  They are not willing to call fedex even after I told them multiple times I don't have their product, I never received a box, it never made it to me, its not in my possession, my neighbors don't have it, and I work at home, I would have been here.  They can check easily, they have the info but are refusing to do so (who does this?)\n\nWill never purchase again from this company.  they are awful.","title":"I hate writing bad reviews but this is\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=6&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-14","author":"El R","text":"Here we go AGAIN\nDELETED PAGE RANDOMLY after i asked about an item I sold  and wasn\u2019t paid for up until 1 month after, they even accused me of not sending it whilst having the receipt.

The buyer chose to have it sent to a London co op pick up point. These arrived on the 10th March. A week or two went by and the item still was not collected. I then had a message from the buyer to ask the postcode of the pick up point as she had been to collect the item and they were not there. I assumed these had been sent back to me as per the terms and conditions of sale. I heard again from the buyer to say these were never there and they were either lost or stolen. Some time had passed by now and nothing had come back to me. I contacted the Vestiaire via e mail to explain the situation. I was told basically to get lost and conduct my own investigation. I wrote back to say I could not due to the fact that the legal contract with evri\\hermes was between the Vestiaire and them not myself. Also pointing out that that under their terms and conditions of sale the item should have been sent back to me by now. They were not with me or my local parcel shop. So today I had another e mail stating I should go to the parcel shop to collect them. The item is not at my local parcel shop it has gone back to London the parcel Schopenhauer chosen by the buyer. Please explain when I live in Bristol how I can travel hundreds of miles to get my property back from London? I feel so sorry for the buyer.
