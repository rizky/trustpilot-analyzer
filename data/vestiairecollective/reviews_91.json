[{"date":"2020-10-29","author":"Simona","text":"UPDATE:\n\norder#: 30620848\n\n\n  12 days after my review on Trustpilot, Vestiaire finally replied to my email. They refused to refund me. They have shifted all the blame on the transporter, who has also denied to take any responsibility for this mess. According to the transporter the bag 'correctly left the warehouse' and the package's weight was on point - even though the delivery man admitted that parcel felt empty to him when picking it up (this conversation between him and the transporting company dispatcher was recorded). \n\n Vestiaire have invited me to file a complaint at the police station and to thereby put on my detective hat and solve this issue by myself somehow. How ridiculous? On Vestiaire's website it clearly states 'all items are insured against theft and accidental damage' and that they 'insure and assume responsibility for all items'. Clearly they do not, as I have been denied a refund. This is false advertising and is illegal. \n\n29\/10\/2020\n\n  A month ago I was naive enough to order a Chloe bag (Drew en cuir) from Vestiaire. Oh boy, do I wish I had come here before making my purchase. It took double the stated amount of time for the bag to arrive and I knew something was wrong. Guess what? The bag finally arrived and well... I GOT AN EMPTY BOX FOR 650 EUROS! Somewhere along the way, someone either opened the box and stole the bag, or it was never put inside the delivery box by the seller in the first place. Either way, this happened 17 days ago and I am still waiting for my money. This is unbelievable. The customer support team have not been helpful at all and keep sending me pre-written phrases and responses and ask me to be patient. Excuse me?! I bought the world's most expensive empty box due to your unprofessionalism and you are asking me to be patient?","title":"I PAID 650 EUROS FOR AN EMPTY BOX!","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=91&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-10-29","author":"Louise","text":"fake fake fake \n\ndon't but from this app i bought shoes that turned out to be fakes don't rely on authentication from them either it's all nonsense... i don't know how they even let these leave the vc office and approved them for authentication it's disgusting \n\nthe fendi sign was falling to bits and looked glued on and the pattern on both shoes where ridiculously different \n\nplease be aware of this company they'll take your money and make it so hard for you to get refunded \n\nreference 7619596","title":"fake fake fake","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=91&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-10-30","author":"\u05e0\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4 \u05e9\u05de\u05e8","text":"Hi,I sold a very expensive item and it got returned to me. \nDHL sent me a photo of the item being delivered but, it wasn\u2019t my building or my actual apartment and he just left it there although he needed to get my signature.\nI am trying to contact vestire with no success.\nIt is a very expensive parcel that DHL just lost because they weren\u2019t following the rules.\nHow can I make a complaint\/ demand vestire to open an investigation and redound for the missing parcel?","title":"Hi,I sold a very expensive item and it\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=91&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-10-30","author":"Susan Stevenson","text":"I lost my trusted seller  status for no reason.

After getting burned on one purchase (the seller listed it as VG, it was fair at best) I use it purely for research and then go hunt down an item on another marketplace. There is no system for reviewing sellers and comments put under a product (like when someone asks a question) vanish a few weeks after appearing so helpful info gets lost. You've no way of knowing how many times an item has been bought and sold again as they just re-use the same photos. Sellers are not obliged to respond to questions and there's no action taken against them if they falsely represent the condition of an item. The site is buggy - the favourites and wishlist function especially bad (when you remove something it keeps sending you price reduction emails anyway and you can't find a way to turn them off - even several months after removing!). Which leads me to their awful unsubscribe options and lack of a clear data protection officer to contact on their unbsubscribe page. In an attempt to stop the phantom price alerts I tried unsubscribing from everything - when I next logged into the app it had subscribed me again! Epic fail for GDPR compliance there. Finally, the app is extremely buggy on Android. After a few minutes browsing you get a \"no internet connection\" error. I ended up switching between data and wifi as doing so seemed to trigger it to reconnect again. \nConclusion: Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid...","title":"Don't bother","stars":2,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=91&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-01","author":"monica","text":"horrible costumer service.

It's now new as it has happened before.\nI've sold the order number 11674543 (an Acne Studios Cardigan). The buyer by mistake (probably) mentioned that there's a problem with my cardigan. Then later the buyer sent me a message that it has been a miss-understanding, that she loves the cardigan and she will keep it.\nThe buyer never sent the cardigan back (as VC told me).\nThe buyer kept the cardigan, and the buyer is super happy about the purchase (the buyer told me so via message).\nI contacted VC's customer service about this payment issue and they told me \"we'll contact you in 3 days). Well almost 2 weeks have passed an NOBODY contacted me. VC's customer service is inexistent, arrogant and useless. To talk to them is like talking to a robot or a wall. Even to talk to a wall could be more rewarding since their agents are very arrogant making the experience very unpleasant. They made me feel like selling bad things (when the true shows that the buyer is very happy with the purchase).\nThis is not the only product it hasn't been paid. There are 6 more products that hasn't been paid yet. I wrote all the codes.\nTo write vis trust pilot is more effective than contacting their arrogant stuff via chat as they only answer you one thing \"we'll send you and email\". It doesn't matter the question or the problem you have, the only answer is: \"we'll send an email\". They never do, or the mail you get from them is merely a technical description of your chat with them. No solution. My problem is genuine. VC exists thanks sellers that create content and they make everything very difficult for sellers. Yes, you can sell some items but it takes a lot of time, nerves and patience. Other secondhand platforms are far more \"human\" with sellers than VC. They seem to hate sellers.","title":"VC don't pay to sellers","stars":1,"location":"LT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=91&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-11-03","author":"Ms WINNIE","text":"Updated 18 Nov 2020\nReceived the money finally\n\nUpdated on 7 Nov 2020\nI haven\u2019t received any reply via email these few days, So I tried to contact VC by chat on 5 Nov, they have no reply for the payment, their reply\u2019s is waiting ONLY!
