Recontacted customer support on 3.02.22 and was told there had been an error and the refund would be processed immediately. But I\u2019m still waiting\u2026\n\nThe support team accepted a return on the Frye boots that were listed a different size. And five days later a refund was issued. \n\nThe website is a cool concept, but it feels like the sellers are the winners and not the buyers. All is ok if the seller is honest, but if they are not, the buyer has to jump through considerable hoops to get the product sent back and a refund issued. Pair that with the long shipping wait (especially if an item needs to be authenticated) and it gets pretty annoying fast.  \n\nThe website is wonderful, and there are a lot of really nice products on sale for good prices. But\u2026 my experience so far with this site has been pretty terrible. \nThe first order I made was for three items. After paying I received a message immediately that actually, one of the items was not available any longer, and I would be reimbursed. The refund took a day to come through. The other two items arrived significantly different to what was described in the listing. A wool jumper in \u2018excellent\u2019 condition, arrived covered in hair and obviously had been shrunk in the wash. The sleeves arrived a halfway between my elbow and wrists. It wasn\u2019t wool either, but a cheap and nasty mix of acrylic and wool. I sent images to the customer support with the jumper in front of another that was the same size, and they agreed to refund me (I returned the jumper yesterday, but the refund has not yet arrived). \nThe third item was a pair of Frye boots. The listing was marked at a 38.5, but instead the boots that arrived were a 7B (I don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t put in the actual size). Anyhow, a Frye 7 corresponds to a size 37-38 (they were significantly smaller than my size 38 boots, so I guess they were a 37.5). Again I had to send images, and mails - and even though I have clearly shown that the boots are not the size they were indicated in the listing, vestiare have not yet agreed to \u2018allow\u2019 a return\/reimbursement. \nEven though the error is all theirs, the consumer is the one that looses. \nSo sorry, but so far Vestiaire is a big thumbs down for me. The shipping is way too high, and the customer service\/ validation of products needs to be improved. For now I\u2019ll stick with Ebay, where at least buyers have some rights\u2026","title":"Big thumbs down from me","stars":2,"location":"IT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=20&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-28","author":"Hristina","text":"My two items ( ref. 19034567 and ref. 18638589) have been missing since the 10.11.2021.

I even left a comment on the page asking the seller to confirm if there are scuffs or damages, to which she said no, it\u2019s \u2018only used once\u2019. Pictures didn\u2019t show damage either when I zoomed into every one of them. Then the product arrived and what?! Peeled leather at the front! It\u2019s obvious that the leather was scraped off! Also corners scratched, showing the white under layer (this isn\u2019t normal darkening?!) I emailed and did a live chat with Vestiaire on the same day and they promised full refund on both occasions. I have photo evidence. \n\nI even have the email proof that they confirmed FULL refund. Nowhere in the correspondence did they say I may be denied refund. They said return the product and my refund will be issued within 48 hours. All these happened within 72 hours of their golden period of relisting without commission btw, so one might think the nightmare is sorted. I shipped the product back to their hub the next business day.\n\nBy then it was beyond 72 hours, catering for an additional 3 days of international shipping. It finally arrived at their hub then they issued an email saying the product was compliant and now I can either 1) have the product back by requesting it within 24 hours 2) relist WITH commission fee DEDUCTED.\n\nI almost wish I made more damages before I returned the product so they have no chance of saying it\u2019s compliant. I emailed them for a proper, formal quality control report. As usual, I got a standard robotic reply. I questioned if the peeled leather and scuffed corners were inspected. If so, how do these \u2018match\u2019 the item description? \n\nTheir customer service team is hard to get. I\u2019m constantly chasing time zone difference trying to get in touch with their team. If they promised full refund via email, especially after the product is successfully returned to them (with proof), their promise and my acknowledgment are written agreements made specific to this transaction. Their practice is not compliant with the Consumer Law.\n\nNote, they have now confiscated the product and my money. I\u2019m not going to stop taking actions and filing complaints with the EU commission until they return my money. Alternatively, prove to me how the product is aligned with its description?","title":"Absolutely no respect to the Consumer Law","stars":1,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=20&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-29","author":"Lulu ","text":"Quality control team is horrible!
