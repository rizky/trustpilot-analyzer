Now I can surely say this is one of the worst ones. Everything became so much expensive, even more than the retail price of some items, Vestiaire increased the direct shipping cost, import duties fee went to a massive amount like 200\u00a3 if you buy from a non European country (if you are in Europe). You cannot find good deals anymore like before. And something important I need to mention is that I bought recently a Gucci bag. I decided to receive it through authenticity check means that the package passed from the Vestiaire warehouse to get to me. When I received the package, it was literally empty with only some papers. I was so disappointed. Took me a month to get my money back. And after the last fact I decided to stop buying from that shop.
