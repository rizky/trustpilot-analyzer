Did some more digging this seller has to different profile selling the exact same items which the price is lower on one account and higher on the other (I brought from the higher) also to make matters worse this person has sold more than 3 of the bag on their pages.

Selling items on this site instead is unbelievable hard, they push you to reduce the price of the sale every week to the point that even brand new items unused or even with the label attached end up selling for little and they take a fixed rate cut of \u00a313 up until about \u00a3110 sale price (which is only convenient for them because they can get their money worth no matter the final price of sale), if the price is superior than they take a % instead (again because at that point they will make more as a %). And if you have a problem they make you wait forever to get back to you and they don't own up to their own mistakes. I sold a basic man Armani suit that was only worn once for a wedding, which took nearly 1 year to sell. The item was returned from the quality control with faults that the suit did not have when I sent it. When I received it back the trouser had 2 massive holes and the buttons of the back pockets looked like they had been torn out. All this was not reported in the description of the quality control report. The trousers also looked like they had been worn by someone that obviously did not fit them which must have happened while they were undergoing the quality control which took so much longer than usual. After waiting for over 1 month with absolutely no communication or update from them regarding the issue, a few days after soliciting a response they ultimately decided to refuse to refund the repair work cost saying that they received the item in that condition, hitherto blaming me for somehow ruining while they were not even in my possession, since I checked the item before sending it and it had no faults. \nThat is it, I am not using this site ever again, the cost of selling\/buying and the poor customer service are just not worth it!\n\nReply 17\/09\/2021\nMy item reference is 11700941, I am extremely disappointed of the service I received which left me feeling mistreated after causing me damage instead of supporting me in the process. I sent to Vestaire an Armani suit in great conditions (no rips or any damage, the suit had its original hanger and suit bag) and got back a ripped one. Additionally, the damage was by your customer service own observation \"unlikely due to transport issue\", so the only thing I have left to believe is that the damage was inflicted at your \"quality and control\" facilities since I inspected the suit myself before shipping it and it had no damage. I have been selling and buying second hand fashion items online for over a decade, I am aware of what standards are expected for an item to pass quality control and would have definitely spared myself all this trouble if the item had had any damage at all, let alone one so evident as ripped seams.","title":"Poor customer service","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=45&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-09-14","author":"Susan Farrow","text":"Horrendous customer service.
