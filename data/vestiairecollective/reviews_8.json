As of now, no follow up and no solution. Horrible experience:(\n\nre: Thank you VC for looking into this. \nRef.17077575 sold on Feb. 11, 2022\nI will update the review depending on the outcome of your investigation. Looking forward to hearing back from you.\n\nI sold a vintage leather bag in very good condition that arrived to the NY hub badly damaged by the courier. It arrived all smashed with a huge hole and the stitching popped out because of some heavy weight applied to it. As an expert seller with a record of over 300 items sold, I clearly know to distinguish between an item in a very good condition vs a destroyed bag. My sale got cancelled and the bag was sent back to me. I immediately contacted VC with request to open an investigation\/claim with a courier. I was advised that they needed more photos from me to do so. Obviously, it wasn't possible while the bag was being shipped back to me. The transport department failed to mark the parcel as a return, so it took almost a month and about 12 emails to get the bag released from the customs. To my great surprise, after I finally received the bag and sent the requested photos to VC in order to open the investigation\/ claim, I got the following response. \"Even if I wanted, to open the investigation\", wrote the agent, \" It wouldn't be possible because there has been a month since the delivery\". I think the quote clearly shows that there has been no intent what's so ever to follow up on my claim initially. I lost both my sale and my item which now is ruined and not wearable\/unsellable. My mistake was to simply follow the advice of the support team instead of filing the damage claim directly with DHL. I guess the fact that I assumed that VC was actually looking into my complaint was wrong, as seen from the ridiculous response \" even if I wanted\", which they clearly implied they didn't in the first place. Too bad it took me 20 emails to exchange to finally understand the point.

Was very satissfied from the start but will not buy here again. Several reasons. 1) Customer service is now only available in the chat and although some are good some just leave the chat in the middle of it or promise to come back by email and don\u2019t do it. Whatever error they make they suggest a 10% voucher for next purchace and write a shablon message about how they understand why you are not happy but they will do better. 2) Got an item with defects that passed the quality control. Good that at least that the return was smooth. 3) Got an item that was over 2000\u20ac without original box although buyer wrote it will come with box. Quality control didn\u2019t notice the box was missing. 4) A Chanel bag I purchaced was 2500\u20ac but because I am in Sweden price was shown in SEK in my Vestiaire app and it said 28133SEK! While according to the exchange rate that day it should have been no more than 26000SEK. So where is +2000SEK (approx. 200\u20ac) comming from? Sadly I checked what price in EUR it was only after purchasing in SEK. If I had switched to EUR in the app and paid in EUR with automatic exchange in my bank account I would hve saved 200\u20ac. Now it went to Vestiaire account I guess because seller only got equivalent to 2500\u20ac minus selling fees of course.
