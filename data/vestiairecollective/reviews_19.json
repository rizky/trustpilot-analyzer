[{"date":"2022-02-01","author":"Mrs Gabeva","text":"One can wish at least a month to pass before VC does something outrageous again, but yes, it is way too much to ask for a low level company full of inexperienced, incompetent and lazy employees whose actions are obviously tolerated by the management to complete the  circle of idiocy. \nMy question is - why bother to give a detailed description of the items why nobody will even bother to read them. In this case - how do they find an item non-compliant as they have never read the description. In this case - a Chanel sweater, very good condition with one loose seam on a button. All this is explained in the description (even with the caption \u201cattention\u201d and there is even a picture of it. To be clear. I also have taken a screenshot of the description (i always do before sending my items and I recommend all of you do the same, because the sneaky ways of VC trying to cover their own incompetencies are numerous). Now, they sent a quality report that they \u201cfound\u201d a tiny issue with the item - \u201cloose seam\u201d. Hello?!?! It has been duly described and shown on a picture. So, to say i am surprised- not at all, it is VC and their bunch of idiotic actions are always expected. But should we keep silent? Absolutely not. Their ratings are dropping and rightfully so. Because customers should voice their experiences and attract attention to VC\u2019s multiple, constant, never ending and growing list of wrongdoings and the reapeting avoidance of  taking any accountability for their lack of professionalism and unfairness which has been ongoing and tolerated within the company. Seems like an official company internal rule.","title":"Totally disgusting","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=19&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-02","author":"annC","text":"Just an awful and VERY expensive experience.","title":"Just an awful and VERY expensive\u2026","stars":1,"location":"DK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=19&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-02","author":"Lara Trindade","text":"This application is not democratic:\n. doesn\u2019t allow you to sell all type of articles\n.

I have sold over 420 items. All our items were were submitted in the usual way where it states our curators will check your submitted items fit within the brand standards. All were listed and therefore were suitable for sale and all of our items where the buyer had requested passed your inspection tests at your hub. Last week I had and e mail to say that my account was being removed on the grounds that several of our sold items did not meet compliance. That\u2019s very strange as you approved them to go on your website once submitted your curation team will carefully check the brand standards and all had passed authentication. The infringement of your terms I am supposed to have breached is not on your website which is illegal. Neither was I invited to show proof of purchase to prove my case. I also notice that other sellers in France Austria Germany U.K. and France are selling the same items. Why haven\u2019t you banned them. Or is this treatment just for me. I don\u2019t understand at all what I am supposed to have done \nI was told my account was deleted so cannot conclude any business outstanding. My profile is still there and it states that I am temporarily unavailable which is a lie. Also since my ban you have let 2 sales go through that I cannot send as I cannot get into my account. You are using my items as bait to attract buyers that cannot buy. So 2 buyers that have purchased since my ban are left disappointed that is firmly on the Vestiaire and not on me \nThere are several outstanding cases that I need closure on. They have been outstanding for some time but I cannot see anything on my account as I am now banned so cannot see their progress. I am not going to accept that you just delete and keep my property I am quite happy to take either you or the buyers to the small claims court to get my money or items back \n\nItem number 19380526 out for delivery since January 12th please pay me or return my item I cannot see an update as I am not allowed into my account \n\nItem number 20203611 and item number 20203611. The buyer purchased 4 pairs of earrings. These two pairs were the same style but different colours. She claimed that they were used. That is impossible as I don\u2019t have pierced ears and all our jewellery is new and authentic. It was a way of try before you buy. No report was sent to me and no evidence provided ie photos. Please return my two items or pay me. This is theft\n\nItem number19345203. Sold on 27th November. The buyer claimed they were broken upon arrival. They were well packed and sent out in perfect condition. Why would I send a broken pair of earrings? I was not given any report. So upon enquiries several weeks later as they had not been returned to me I was told she had been allowed to keep them for a further week to try to effect a repair. This was without my consent and illegal. When I got them back one earring was broken in two and half melted. The damage was made far worse as some one had try to solder them. Looking in the packaging there was just a lump of melted metal from a botched repair. Please pay me for my item as you allowed further damage to my item without my consent. These were sent out in perfect condition \n\nItem number 20267011 was at your hub when you banned me. Surprise surprise a tiny issue with them. But I could not see the report as you have banned me. Please return my item I will wait to see what the issue is as these were in perfect condition when sent. I cannot re sell them as you have banned me \n\nI cannot express my disgust enough at the way I have been treated. As I say I am happy to sue you or the buyers to get my property back. I am also happy to go to the media to tell them how I have tried and convicted. And how badly you treat people with no consistent policy. As others are still selling the same items. I find it amazing that you are using my items as bait and wrongfully telling buyers to check back later. On the day I was banned without explanation I found out I was seriously ill. So please conclude the above as quickly as possible so I don\u2019t have to waste any more time on your ridiculous company that make the rules up as they go along. If my sold items did not meet compliance please refund the \u00a36000 in fees I have paid. I cannot wait to part company\n\nThank you for your reply there is a further item that needs attending to. The item number is 20267315 these have been outstanding since 20th January.
