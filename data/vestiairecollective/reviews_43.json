Purchased a Burberry trench coat and paid for authentication. The item was described as the \u2018long version\u2019 however when it arrived it was 10cm too short. I raised this with Vestiaire seeking a refund and was told twice that the \u201cexpert team confirmed it matched the description and that it was the long version\u201d. Upon sharing an exchange with Burberry which confirmed the jacket was indeed too short to be the \u201clong version\u201d, Vestiaire agreed that they would take a second look at it. Having lost all faith in Vestiaire\u2019s authentication process I took a closer look at the jacket and noticed the stitching was shoddy and the check print underneath the collar does not align to Burberry\u2019s standards. I then also raised my concerns that I believed the coat to be a counterfeit. Vestiaire have this morning re-listed the coat for sale on my behalf claiming it matches the sellers original description and meets the brand\u2019s standards, however conveniently they have amended the description to remove reference to it being the \u201clong version\u201d. I feel completely scammed and have asked repeatedly for this to be raised as a formal complaint and to be refunded to no avail. I am currently out of pocket for customs and authentication fees when the coat should never have been posted to me in the first place.","title":"Avoid avoid avoid","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=43&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-09-28","author":"Soosan","text":"A very frustrating platform with woeful customer service.

After several days of not receiving my item back, I spoke to UPS who confirmed that since the label was created from Vestiaire\u2019s account, they are on record as the shipper, the scarf was returned to them. \nI can see clearly on the tracking that my scarf was delivered to NY and signed for by someone with initials \u201cFD\u201d. However Vestiaire is claiming to have no knowledge of this policy by UPS and is stating they cannot locate the item. \nThey are requesting me to open a claim knowing that since I am not on UPS\u2019s account as the shipper, I am not able to open a claim with UPS. They are on account as the shipper since they generate all the labels. \n\nNeat trick to have undelivered items shipped to Vestiaire\u2019s warehouse instead of back to the sellers. Then claim not to have knowledge that the item was returned to them. Refusing to communicate with UPS directly. Telling the seller to open a claim that they know we cannot open because \u201cwe are not in UPS\u2019s system as the shipper\u201d\u2018. \n\nVestiaire confiscates undeliverable expensive items and resells them.

All they constantly say about all different topics is \u00ab\u00a0we are sorry, we forgot to update this\u00a0\u00bb or \u00ab\u00a0we are escalating this issue blablabla\u00a0\u00bb\u2026.

SORRY!!!??? Almost all your customers are using your app instead of your -again- dysfunctional web site. How come you cannot update such an important info on your app?! VC is also advertising about their commissions going lower. NO! This is not true.\nAnd about the counterfeit products, few weeks ago I stumbled upon a grey Chanel double flap classic bag, which was FAKE and a very very bad one, with the VC \u201cwe love\u201d label.

However, the custom support told me that the product would be sent to me, so I decided to wait for the product without replying.\nHowever, on 9\/9 I found that the item I was trading with was being relisted on Vestiaire. The custom support said the transaction was still ongoing. Was it canceled? Even so, there is no contact from the support center. Of course, no money has been returned.\nMy number one request is  the support center will encourage the seller to ship the item to me. Or Vestiaire will properly contact me for cancellation and refund. Either of these.\nI just don't know why the seller relisted. Did the seller get a notice of cancellation? If so, why is Vestiaire not contacting me who is paying?\nThe website says that if it does not ship within 15 business days, they will refund me.And the custom support also said same thing to me.\n\nAfter that, I contacted the support center again on Sep 24th. They say they have contacted the seller and she has sent the item.They say refunds will be given as soon as shipping failure is proven. I was informed that they decided to leave this matter to their expert team.\nAfter that, I received the following email from the expert team on Sep 26th. \n\n>>Hi {ticket.requester.first_name}},\n\n>>We've not forgotten you!\n\n>>Our teams are still working on a solution for you, and we're really sorry for the unusual delay in getting back to you.
