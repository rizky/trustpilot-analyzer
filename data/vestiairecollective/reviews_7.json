The money has never reached my bank account. I raised the issue 4 times via email, chat and FB with no results! They just tell me that they have made the payment, but when i explain that i have not received the money, they promise to investigate it and just disappear!!! There is no way to call them so i just have to keep raising the issue with no response!! This is really frustrating! And we are talking about 1224 euros here!! Terrible customer service!

Hope the problem is resolved soon and I will get my money. I will update this review accordingly, depending on the situation.\n\nI finally got my payment. I would still say though that Vestiaire can improve the work of their customer service. It is frustrating when you don\u2019t get any replies on your emails. Also regular update on the status of the query would be much appreciated.","title":"Problems with payments and terrible customer service","stars":3,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-08","author":"Diana Tavares","text":"worst costumer care ever ! i pay for the control and authentication and receive a bag in another shade. the item describes fuchsia and i rev\u00abceive a different kind of pink! the \"expert\" team is a joke. they didn`t refund me. it was like talking to a rock. forget about this site. if it goes wrong you will never see your money back...","title":"worst costumer care ever","stars":1,"location":"PT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-08","author":"Liv","text":"Sent my sold item on time and buyer has received the item and the 72 hour evaluation period is long over.

Sorry for the rant but...\n\nI ordered an item in OCTOBER 2021. I finally got it in April 2022. Seller sent it on time, no problem. It went to Vestiaire... that's where it all went downhill. They sent it out to my address.... without my address line. Like, literally my Apartment number, Post code, and City. No street name, nothing. Sent back to the Vestiaire warehouse obviously because it couldn't be delivered without a street name (not that anyone from Vestiaire told me or emailed me that it came back, I had to find out myself later by asking). I message Customer Services - they're like, \"Oh yeah, it's here! :-) :-P\" Ok cool thanks for telling me. Ask for it to be sent out again. I tell them: for the love of god, use my correct address it's very IMPORTANT. (Please note my address is correct ON THE VESTIAIRE WEBSITE so it's not on me that they keep sending it incorrectly. I wrote it out again for them in the service chat). They say of course... long story short they re-attempt delivery with the same wrong address... wait for it... three more times. I mean, it's almost laughable. So - whatever - all trust in this site gone, can I at least have my delivery charge refunded? No response EVER. I have now asked maybe 7 times? Their response is always \"Sorry this delay has happened, I'm here to help!\" and I have to keep replying \"Please refund me\". They're not even saying no they just don't answer to that. It's like in their customer service guide it says \"Just don't engage until the customer loses their mind and gives up out of sheer insanity and exhaustion\".\n\nConsidering the price you're paying on this \"luxury retailer site\"... I say run. Ebay, Vinted, ANYTHING ELSE. This is bad bad bad. Don't even get me started on how the products they have on there are 50% good sellers, selling their ware, but then 50% just people buying new designer and jacking up the price... even though you can just buy it literally yourself straight from the designer's site. Vestiaire does nothing about it. Expert vintage sellers I follow have also posted about clear fakes being posted on Vestiaire. Whole site is just bad news.","title":"Oh my goodness where to even start...","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-09","author":"Tanya Harbas  from Croatia","text":"Dear VC agent\n\nIn response to your email please note :\nYes, it appears I was paid or at least VC attempted to pay me .Wrong name \u2026my account details !\nAfter ten days my bank send money back as they would not release funds .\nOn Tuesday 3 April I sent My banks report to VC.support pro .\nThe ball is in Vestiaire Collective court now !\nHopefully this will be soon sorted out .\n\nTanija","title":"Dear VC agent","stars":1,"location":"HR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-10","author":"alix","text":"I have not received the payment.
