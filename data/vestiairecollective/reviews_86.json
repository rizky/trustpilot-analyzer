There is absolutely no standard. And the prices they suggest is always different for the same item listed at different days of the week.

The item was supposed to be in pristine condition. I paid for a Quality Control check, and that is the only reason why I bought it via VC (I just trust it way more than other marketplaces). It is no surprise I obviously chose to pay the quality control and authenticity check.\nThis week, as the cold season kicked in, I used the jacket for the first time and I was surprised by its lack of warmth (something Woolrich jackets are famous for). Next, I contacted Woolrich because I was missing one of the buttons (something your QC department was apparently not able to check). That triggered a series of back-and-forths with the original manufacturer, that conclusively led me to believe that the jacket is a fake: unexisting model number, missing key arctic parka labels, wrong logo used on the velcro, buttons without \"Woolrich\" written on them, color of the jacket that is just off.\n\nI have been completely let down by this experience. This was my first purchase in a clothing marketplace, and notably my first VC purchase.\n\n\nP.D.: VC checked my jacket and after all the evidence I provided, they still claim the jacket is authentic. Woolrich, the original manufacturer, said they could not help me out because the jacket was not authentic. This is ridiculous.
