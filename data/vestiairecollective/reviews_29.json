I used their website to search for a Bottega Venetta Handbag. The search produced a number of results for \"Handbags\". I bought one from a seller named Amina. She listed it as a bag and in the subcategory \"bags\". Naturally, as it is listed in the bag section, I'd assume that what I was buying was actually a bag. But upon my purchase I discovered from looking into the product online it was actually a purse that can't even be used as a bag. I complained to Vestiaire and I had a Charmane Salazar reply. She didn't even bother looking into the details or have any regard to the fact the item was listed misleadingly as a bag. She just copied and pasted the item description and said that was enough to inform me that what I was buying was not actually a bag. When I replied to explain the item had been listed incorrectly, she simply responded with the same email and didn't bother acknowledging or replying to the points I raised. Probably a bot, as VC aren't interested in customer service they're solely for profit and the commission on sales. So will dismiss any concerns you put to them if it gets in the way of making a sale. So this is a great website for fraudulent and poor quality items. As a seller you'll get away with a whole host of issues, it's as good as selling on the black market - no questions asked by VC. So if you want, as a seller you can mislead buyers, Vestiaire will take no responsibility or even cancel the sale for you.They just want the commission and give absolutely no damn about whether you're being conned or not. I would strongly advise taking your money elsewhere, this company will not protect you from being defrauded on your money. Once I receive my purse, I will cancel my account and will never again use this website.\n\nThe reference\/order number is as follows:Bottega Veneta - Pouch leather mini bag - Ref : 18758472\n\n17.12.21\nSo I received the item today. It's beyond belief that VC would even allow the seller to list it as a handbag. It's a purse that is even smaller than my own purse!! I've also just received an email from VC stating the following:\n\n\"I\u2019m pleased to say our team has agreed to check your item again. If we find that the item does match the description provided, we will relist the item for sale on your account, minus our usual commission, and store it safely at our hub until it sells. Alternatively, we can ship it back to you at your request\". \n\nSo in other words, if you've been mis-sold an item, they won't give you a refund, they'll just do you the favour of relisting it. Problem solved as far as VC is concerned. I think I might just make a mockery of the whole thing and relist it myself. Lets see what happens if I use their platform to con someone else like they conned me then.","title":"SCAM company AVOID","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=29&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-12","author":"el","text":"would give 0 stars if i could. bought a cartier vintage bag from there but i didn\u2019t like it when it came, went back in the box and resold it in vestiaire. when it came to shipping that was a nightmare, the courier didn\u2019t turn up day after day and it took me talking to 3 separate agents to get the courier to actually turn up. then the buyer contested the item, which was strange as it has been in the box since i bought it? then i received an email from the courier telling me the item was being returned! vestiaire hasn\u2019t even contacted me with any kind of details about why!! for days!!! i had to go through an agent on the chat feature to confirm.

After 2 weeks the buyer still had not collected them so I contacted Vestiaire via an online chat \u201cbot\u201d but eventually chatted online to someone whom I think was a real person! I was informed in that chat exchange that my shoes would automatically be returned if the buyer did not pick them up after 2 weeks. I\u2019ve made contact via chat and email with Vestiaire several time as it\u2019s now been 5 weeks and my shoes haven\u2019t been returned and they have not been collected from the collection point.

Vestiaire does not allow you to speak with them directly and everything is done through regular generic automated emails stating simply they are looking into the situation! I have emailed re a refund for my shoes or returning my shoes but they will not repairs to my request for a refund or shoes in return! Please be very aware of using this site as the security and insurance regarding the loss of your items may not be in place and you may be left out of pocket. I am still awaiting the return of my shoes or a refund but through this process have had no contact directly with a member of staff to ensure that I will get them back or a refund of the \u00a3300! They put pressure on you via emails to quickly get your goods sent out as the buyer is waiting etc but when it comes to taking care of customers and loss of expensive items they aren\u2019t helpful or supportive and send generic emails to placate you. There are other sites out there where you can speak directly with customer service and care so my advice would be choose one of those before this company.","title":"Beware no payment and no refund for goods","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=29&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-14","author":"XYANG","text":"If I can I\u2019ll give it no star!

Hermes shows the package in transit, Vestiaire is Hermes' customer, they have all the tracking details showing the parcel is delayed and they have the buyer's details. What on earth do they need the paper receipt for (although I provided it, it's meaningless).\n\nIt is truly pathetic that Vestiaire is unwilling, unable or both to resolve a lost parcel issue that they are responsible for.
