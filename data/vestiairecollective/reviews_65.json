I had what should have been an easy problem to fix: a week had passed without the seller shipping an item I bought, which is the deadline given to sellers when they make a sale (this is very clearly written out in the FAQ's and in the instructions sent to you with each sale). I explained this a number of times in the customer service chat and literally attached screenshots of VC's own written policy from their FAQ's, and the agent kept insisting on me waiting as they tried to get a hold of the seller (which I got notifications of them doing throughout the week - the seller in this case was just seemingly inactive). I insisted that this made no sense, as it meant that either the solution I was being given was incorrect (to wait 2 more weeks before my order being cancelled), or that VC's FAQ and policy of sellers having one week to ship an item is a lie. The agent tried to give me explanations that contradicted their FAQ, and when maybe it became very clear that I was the correct one in this exchange and that I was not going to stop messaging, I was KICKED OUT OF THE LIVE CHAT. I didn't even know companies could do this! I thought maybe my wifi went out, but that wasn't the case as I was able to open other tabs and windows and sites just fine. The \"Live Chat\" button was greyed out, and when I tried clicking the sticky question mark help button at the bottom right of the page, which normally brings up the live chat modal, I was prompted directly to just fill out an email form rather than speak to a rep! Truly a mind boggling exchange.\n\n1\/5 stars for my recent experience, 5\/5 for my usual buying\/selling experience.

The app asked me to refresh my address so they could resend my package, and after doing so several times and trying to reach customer service, the package was once again sent to Denmark with the wrong address label, and can not be delivered.

My choices are - take the financial hit, or lie to the next unsuspecting woman. I strongly believe both of these dresses are bought and sold multiple times across this platform, then vestiaire forces the disgruntled buyer to incorrectly advertise using their platform.

VC team when checking them pointed out that the heels have signs of wear providing one photo with some marks - looking like dirt, offering to discount an item by \u00a313 if I still wanted them. Trusting them that marks presented on photos are accurate I accepted the offer. Heels arrived and they are brand new with no signs of wear BUT with DEFECTS. Marks assumed to be wear are in fact discolouration - heels caught dye from something. Any attempt to remove the dye results in paint coming off - they already arrived with white patches with no paint. Heels also came with dent sole and only one dust bag - YSL provides 2 dust bags, one is not big enough to fit both shoes. I contacted then VC both on a chat and by email and they don\u2019t think they\u2019re at fault. \u00a313 was also provided in a form of voucher to use a on VC website and not a refund, it does not compensate anything. It seems like misadverting the item is completely fine. Now to fix the heels and repaint them will cost a lot of money, and additional time and effort. On the photos used by the listing heels seem to be in a perfect condition. On the only photo provided by VC with caption \u201cwear\u201d one can see few dirt marks.
