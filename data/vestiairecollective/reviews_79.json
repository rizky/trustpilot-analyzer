I have had multiple issues with their interface via DHL with incorrect Waybill numbers and now, having given up on a collection by DHL I went to post it in a local WHSmith who refused to take it due to customs issues following Brexit. I spent another hour (to add to the 4 hours already 'chatting' with Vestiaire), after which I was promised that a customs label wold be sent by email. It hasn't arrived. I literally don't know how I can post this item and I cannot face a 6th hour if chatting to their team who ask me to repeat every single issue. The item will be received late and Im sure that will impact my ratings as a seller. I notice they have no 'customer service' making it even more infuriating. If I don't get a resolution today I am taking it to all over their social media. I am also removing all of my items from sale as I give up on this useless company.","title":"Impossible user interface and customs issue","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=79&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-01-17","author":"Jindan Seo","text":"i bought hermes card wallet from here.\nand it comes with  teased part on middle of wallet\n\nit doesnt appears on picture\n\nbut when i contact ( i contacted within 1 min from when i received parcel. )\n\ncoustomer center, they said\nthey cant refund or return. \nthey asked me to re-list to resell\n\nit is oubiously that they asked me to scam others by selling teased item with picture which not appears on.\n\nif u buy from this website, and it comes fault, they dont accept return and refund , and they asked to fool other people in their website \n\nand it goes on and on and on  among people who using that webstie.\n\nref 1987699","title":"i bought hermes card wallet from here.","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=79&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-01-17","author":"Jindan Seo","text":"i bought hermes card wallet from here.\ni bought hermes card wallet from here.\nand it comes with teased part on middle of wallet\n\nit doesnt appears on picture\n\nbut when i contact ( i contacted within 1 min from when i received parcel. )\n\ncoustomer center, they said\nthey cant refund or return.\nthey asked me to re-list to resell\n\nit is oubiously that they asked me to scam others by selling teased item with picture which not appears on.\n\nif u buy from this website, and it comes fault, they dont accept return and refund , and they asked to fool other people in their website\n\nand it goes on and on and on among people who using that webstie.\n\nref 1987699","title":"i bought hermes card wallet from here.","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=79&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-01-17","author":"Irene Aversa","text":"I am trying to download the tag needed in order to ship the package (a bag) to the client but every time I try to download it it says \u201cno match for address input\u201d.

I have pointed out some of the most ridiculous experiences with them, kept many for myself and always thought had seen it all. But not. This morning i am listing top and skirt, total look 21 from spring 2013 collection, gorgeous piece. Pristine condition. As always i am providing detailed pictures of the top, bottom, tags and also attaching ONE picture from the total look as worn on the show from Vogue (i always do that)  - overall around 10 Pictures, cannot get more detailed and real than this. I always do that and is actually a very nice thing to do because gives the potential buyers the full idea. Not even 30 Minutes later i receive this ridiculous message (it is just too insane to try to describe it so i am copy\/pasting it). First - who actually had the time to review the listing in 30 Minutes and if they actually did that means that the \u201cexpert team\u201d consists of fully underdeveloped amateurs who keep deceiving the customers on the platform that they actually have any kind of knowledge or understanding of the fashion world, collections, etc. If maybe it is actually the compuer system rejecting it , we can only imagine the so pompously advertised team of \u201cexperts \u201c is actually a computer system. That they do not have a \u201cteam of experts \u201c we all know, but that they might not even have a team - that is kind of a new \u201cinvention\u201d pulled out from their bag of outrageous surprises from the side of Vc.

Every external facing experience including its customer chat service, app and web UX, and listing process is counter-intuitive, debilitatingly inefficient, and on the brink of defunct. \n\nTheir tech issues are a joke. This is an ecommerce platform that cannot support basic ecommerce activities. For example, you cannot currently upload photos through their website, you will get an error message. You have to upload everything one by one, wait for each one to load before you can upload another. And after all that work? The changes will take up to 2-3 days for a team to arbitrarily approve the photos. Uploading your profile photo for your account is equal amount of fun. But for your profile photo, you cannot upload through the app. You will get an error message. You can upload through their website, but the profile photo will only stay on your profile for around 24 hours before it self deletes. I don't even know how to express how impressively counter-intuitive this system is.\n\nThe listing process is another laughing stock. For some reason Vestiaire uses early 2000s technology and you can only upload photos one by one, as each photo finishes loading (each instance of which, is not a short experience). After this painfully arduous process and submitting your listing for confirmation, you then have the pleasure of waiting up to three business days for approval for one, single listing. The listing gets passed onto a \"curation\" team. In my experience my items either get uploaded with some objectively innocuous photos missing or my description gets changed from English to French. The site will translate it back to English for you, but the machine translates it differently and oftentimes the translation makes no sense. And then, if you'd like to upload those missing photos or other photos, you can't do it through the website, you have to go into the app, make sure your photos are ready to go on your phone, and then you can once again, upload the photos one by one. Each time the photo loads, it takes you back to your items page, so you need to select the item, pick upload more photos and then upload photo, and wait for it to load, and then start all over again for another photo for the same listing. And that's only if your listing gets approved. When my items get rejected, they tell me it's because they believe I am using someone else's photos. But i have only been uploading original content that belong to me. And there is no way to argue this and your listing relisted. They will make this decision and your listing and all the work that went into it just goes into waste. If you go to customer service about this, they will simply tell you to resubmit the listing with \"better\" or \"enhanced\" photos, even though the problem was they were accusing me of using stolen IP. So, I have no choice but to resubmit listings repeatedly with no idea what photos they are looking for. And the truth is, they don't know what they are looking for. Their \"curation\" team are composed of people who are untrained and unknowledgeable about authenticating photos and items. Their decisions are completely arbitrary. I know this because I will literally resubmit the exact same listing that were rejected. No change whatsoever. Attributes, description, pictures, price point, everything all the same. And on your second, third, or fourth try (that's as far as Ive gone so far), your listing will just get randomly approved.\n\nThe experiences of the chat service are consistently inconsistent. Sometimes they can remove an image from a listing immediately, other times they claim they don't have that power. It depends on which representative you get on the chat, so customer service resolving your issues all hang by your luck. Competency is a serious issue there. The reps often ignore your messages and will ask you to repeat your request multiple times despite that it has already been communicated and it's still all typed there for them to see. I have had chat experiences where they literally ask me for the same reference numbers three times in the same chat, each time I gave it to them, and they will still ask you for it again and again. It is absurd. They will also blame the business' problems on the sellers, gaslighting us. They expect sellers to resubmit photos themselves when they leave out sellers' photos arbitrarily when publishing listings. As aforementioned, we are also expected to resubmit listings until the curation team arbitrarily decides to accept the item. I cannot fully describe how truly awful working with reps there is.\n\nReally hope Vestiare customers will just transition fully to Poshmark, where the technology makes sense and customer service is eons more professional.","title":"The Worst UX in Ecommerce - Vestiaire Collective","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=79&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-01-20","author":"Jectin","text":"I never post reviews online but I really felt I had to so that this does not happen to anyone else. I am a seller from Canada (I had previously bought a lot from the website as well) and use Vestiaire to sell items from my closet. I've been selling for over a year and had not run into any issues - I was granted expert seller status.\n\nHowever, it seems that recently Vestiaire has hired completely incompetent quality control staff. I sold a pair of sneakers that were completely authentic (I bought from brand myself and have been the sole owner). I also kept the receipt both in my email and a hard copy. I send the item to Vestiaire and it is deemed non compliant due to authenticity. They cancel the sale. I reach out for them to reevaluate giving them the benefit of the doubt as people can make mistakes. They already have the hard copy receipt and I send them an electronic receipt for review. They still reject the item. Now I'm stuck paying a fee to get it back and because I live internationally, it will have to go through customs and I'm going to have to pay large customs fees to get my item back (as the price of the item is high). \n\nSo you are telling me Vestiaire, that I sold over 100 authentic items and then all of a sudden decided to send you a fake? Does that even make sense to you? \n\nFor anyone contemplating selling on this platform, please don't. Save yourself the stress and frustration of randomly getting your item rejected for no reason other than the quality control team felt like it. You have been warned. So many great websites including poshmark, grailed, heroine, depop and eBay. \n\nBottom line: Vestiaire will randomly reject your sold items despite overwhelming evidence of authenticity and then never admit they are wrong.
