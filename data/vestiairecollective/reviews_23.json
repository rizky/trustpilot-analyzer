[{"date":"2022-01-12","author":"A. Kazemi","text":"The UK (Crawley) branch of this \u201ccompany\u201d is a total disgrace! Run by a bunch of unskilled, unprofessional, wannabe \u201cexpert authenticator\u201d cowboys who are completely CLUELESS at doing anything that they have been employed to do! They are NOT experts, they are unskilled fools!  Speaks volumes of the kind of amateurs this company chooses to employ! This is evident in their requirements for the job role which only ask that the applicant holds either a \u201cqualification in fashion\u201d or has a \u201cpassion for fashion\u201d! Absolutely disgusting to be putting any useless fool in charge of processes such as quality control! \nThis is the second item for which the complete morons have generated two reports filled with inaccuracies and false statements and due to their bullsh*t I have had sales cancelled; all based on their incompetence and falsehood! It seems as though it is the same individual clown based at Crawley who is directly responsible for these false reports so beware of sending your valuables to this dodgy, unreliable branch as it will most likely result in your time being wasted and losing out on potential straightforward sales! I am now starting legal proceedings against them as I have clear evidence of their statements being completely false. They are either blatant lies that they feel compelled to tell because these useless amateurs feel as though they need to pull s**t out of their a*s even if there is nothing wrong with the item that has been sent to them in order to fulfil their job requirements. This is how pathetic they are! They have no shame or remorse in inconveniencing others due to their sheer dumbness or to make themselves feel worthy by generating reports full of bs and they actually think they can get away with it time and time again! Well they are going to be in for one hell of a wakeup call when they receive a legal claim backed by full evidence to disprove their bs and prove exactly what a bunch of incompetent fools this company chooses to employ! These fools are uneducated in the industry, have no real experience under their belts and their \u201cpassion for fashion\u201d gives them no right whatsoever to go around jeopardising peoples\u2019 sales! These types of dodgy so called companies run by the most unethical pr*ts who go around employing any idiot and putting them in charge of things that are way beyond their scope, need to be exposed to the public in every way possible, including media coverage and on every social media platform as they love to advertise themselves by portraying an image of something else completely, deceiving others into thinking they are 100% legit! Attempting to cover up the fact that they have been constant f ups for as long as they\u2019ve existed by using terms such as \u201cwe are fashion activists, we are helping the planet, we promote circular fashion, we work with Selfridges\u201d but they fail to tell people how they will rip them off with hefty fees, put valuable items in the hands of incompetent and clearly inexperienced fools who will in turn generate a pack of lies without a second thought, if an item you order from their dodgy platform happens to go missing they will give you maximum hassle and stress for months on end in an attempt to mentally exhaust you into deciding not to pursue a refund, their so called \u201ccustomer support\u201d is nothing but another sick joke operated by the most useless agents who have no authority to do anything and the only thing they\u2019ll tell you is \u201cwe will have to pass this on and will be in touch via email\u201d so you might as well be talking to a robot! \nThere is a reason why this disgraceful company has endless 1 star reviews (which in almost every case would have been zero stars had there been the option) with both buyers and sellers equally disgusted at their experiences and the issues they have had to endure due to this unethical platform. It needs to be brought to the attention of Selfridges too as working with such an infamously disgraceful company will only ever prove to be a liability for any business and for a reputable, long established company like Selfridges to be working with these morons, they must be completely oblivious to their horrendous reputation.","title":"Disgraceful UK (Crawley) Branch Run By Incompetent Clown!","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-13","author":"Gogoncea Isabella","text":"Hello!Is there anybody that Can help me with a telephone number from Vestiaire Collective,please?I got scamed and for about 1 month and a half they don\u2019t give me an answer at the mails.Thank you!","title":"Hello!Is there anybody that Can help me\u2026","stars":1,"location":"RO","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-13","author":"Emily","text":"I've used VC for a couple years now and have had no problems with the company up until today. I bought a leather ALLSAINTS jacket that was listed as 'very good condition'. After receiving the item, it was not in good condition at all. There was numerous areas of fading, stains and tears in the item. I asked VC for a refund since the item did not match the description and the issues I reported were not initially photographed, and all they said was that I can re-list the item for the same price I bought it for\/using the previous seller's description. So essentially VC wants someone else to get scammed? I've now lost money and am stuck with a bad jacket. All I want is a refund (will gladly send the jacket back to VC for them to sell). If this cannot be done I won't be a customer with them anymore and will tell everyone I know about how horrible\/deceitful their service is...\n\n\nRe: VC\u2019s response - the item was only newly listed as \u201cgood condition\u201d instead of \u201cvery good\u201d is because I had to reach out to VC directly and ask them to change it since it wouldn\u2019t allow me to do it myself.  This idea of \u201cif the item you bought doesn\u2019t match the original description, just re-sell it\u201d IS WRONG. You should have a proper return policy in place for when these things happen. I have no idea if the new buyer will be happy with the item but since this is all your policy allows for there\u2019s nothing I can do.\n\nREF 20279958","title":"Beyond disappointed","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-13","author":"Ditte Bille","text":"I've sold so many items on different second hand platforms and it's always been easy and both as seller and buyer. But never have I ever experience such a bad platform - especially if you're a seller. \n\nFirst of all, I send my email address to a potential buyer once(!) in a message - because I didn't know that wasn't allowed. Then I was BANNED from the chat for 24h?! Kind of extreme and send a message that you don't give a s h i t about your consumers. And all their \"customer service\" do is give you a lot of copy paste answers and are in no way interested in helping you. She actually send me wink smiley face when I expressed how bad an experience this is. It's clear to me that they don't listen to you as a single person but just have these black\/white automated rules that they are in no way interested in taking a closer look at for each complain.\n\nSecond of all, it's extremely hard to even create an add as there are SO MANY rules! I don't think I've ever waiting that long to have my items online. \n\nThird of all, if a potential buyer make an offer on the item you're selling, you accept it and they don't buy your item anyway and actually DECLINE it again, you can't accept any other offer in 24h. So you loose a lot of potential buyers. You should be able to accept more than one offer and than it's just up to the bidders to buy it first.\n\nAnd finally, WOW Vestiaire Collective take a HIGH amount of the payment - both as seller and buyer. I have never seen such high percentage being taking from the platform. It makes it impossible to negotiate as you will receive so much less as a seller and pay so much more as a buyer. I don't know how you would even justify this.\n\nYou should really take a look at how other second hand platforms are doing it - for example \"Trendsales\". It's so easy to be professional and yours is just so outdated, lack customer service and understanding and just so, so, so bad. I mean, really bad. And please take a look at your employees. It's almost embarrassing the answers you get in the chat.","title":"The worlds worst second hand website","stars":1,"location":"DK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-13","author":"Ivona Buzov","text":"Avoid, avoid , avoid because this is a scam company.

Fair enough, I didn\u2019t realise I should have added this in my description, so they sent the bag back to me and I relisted it for sale once again, clearly stating about the missing hologram. The bag sold once again for a lower price and this time Vestiaire collective have rejected it all together saying they failed to authenticate it and cancelled the sale automatically. The bag still had the tag from the first sale - the tag that approves the item and has details of the person who inspected the bag. Now I have to pay for the bag to be returned to me which is pretty ridiculous. It\u2019s a Chanel boy as well, not exactly a complicated bag to authenticate, I seriously wonder about the professionalism of the people they hire as \u201cexperts\u201d!!! Not impressed at all, their commission is ridiculously high and I am seriously doubting I will continue selling with them. On top of that, yes, you can\u2019t return items and get refunds!
