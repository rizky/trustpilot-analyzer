I would say about 2 in 5 orders are not fulfilled, because VC does not vet the sellers in any way, they do not weed out bad sellers even after customers submit complaints; I've had 5 orders that ended up being cancelled by the sellers (12213693, 16298391, 18477332, 14089082 and most probably item 12067402 will be cancelled, since I sent the seller four messages and got ghosted), for various reasons (either the seller simply ignored me until the time to ship the item had expired, or they said the item was no longer available although the listing was still active on the website). \n\nI've had absolutely no support from VC in these cases, they simply shrug and tell me I will eventually get refunded. The refund takes quite some time to process, and because they charge in Euros I lose some money with each transaction back and forth (my bank refunds me a lower amount than what VC charges). Their customer support team are absolutely useless, so do not even bother getting in touch with them. They copy and paste some standard replies, sometimes completely irrelevant to your question or complaint. I've never even gotten so much as a lousy 10 Euros voucher for all the fees I lost in these transactions.\n\nI plan on submitting a formal complaint to the customer protection authorities because it is getting absolutely ridiculous. I would strongly advise anyone reading this  to stay away from this website, it's a gamble if your order will get fulfilled or not, or what sort of items you'll get. Not worth it.\n\nUPDATE: Of course I never got item 12067402, no reason provided. All these sellers that do not fulfil orders are still active on the platform, absolutely no sanction applied.

I am getting absolutely nowhere with support having spoken over 10 times to multiple colleagues and receiving no further information over the last 10 days.\nI have a current outstanding Order Ref #17080621, of a Chanel bag. There have been multiple issues with the purchase - Firstly the seller was refused collection due to Vestiaire having not provided the correct sales information for expedition out of the UK to Vestiaire authentication warehouse. This took 4 days to rectify and ended up with the seller and I having to bombard them to sort the issue. When the carrier eventually accepted, they then were further delayed and vestiaire had to be in contact again to get it processed to leave the UK.\nOnce it was finally delivered to Vestiaire, I received multiple notifications one on 03\/12 saying it was in authentication, Another on 06\/12 stating it was again back in authentication. I contacted to try & understand why It was going back through authentication. I did not receive any feedback on this, just that they would raise with the \"relevant team\". The following day 07\/12 it was deemed compliant and I was told it would be shipped that day and they were sorry for the inconvenience. Here I am today... still the item has not been shipped. I have contacted multiple times via their appalling chat service and was told I would receive a call about an issue. No Call and have provided multiple numbers for their contact. I am being told nothing more than they do not know why it's not been shipped.\nThe item was a gift and you have a process time of 14 days from seller sending to buyer receiving and I'm at 15 days since purchase with nothing having been shipped. The item is a gift and therefor I would really appreciate this being looked at. \nAt current I cannot provide positive feedback as I am still waiting and no updates. I would not look to buy again through them after this experience.\n\n- Vestiaire please feel free to reach out to me on this to rectify and ensure my parcel is sent out. I appreciate you're busy but I purchased this in November and I really would like the item.\n\nUPDATE: So I finally heard back of Vestiaire with a tracking number on Friday and my order was dispatched. Sadly recieved today and the item was missing from the parcel. The parcel has been opened on the underneath and I have been left with a box of tissues and some metal screws in replacement of what is meant to be a Chanel bag. I am utterly horrified at the whole situation and that now I have had to re-engage with Vestiaire to get this sorted and try and get my money back. I have an open investigation with them and the courier\u2026 so will update when this has been completed. I am sad and so angry, but cannot make any further remark on Vestiaire until the investigation into the stolen item has been completed and hopefully they refund my money :(\n\nFURTHER UPDATE 30 days later:\nStill no resolution from Vestiaire on my missing bag. It\u2019s now been 7 weeks since I ordered and a month since the parcel was delivered damaged. I keep being told investigation is ongoing but they originally advised 7-15 days for resolution with the carrier. It\u2019s been 30 and I\u2019m still nowhere near. I have opened up a dispute with my credit card due to them not providing a resolution and will continue through that to try and get my money back.
