If you\u2019d like to have it shipped to you, we just ask that you pay a fee of 12 \u00a3\/\u20ac\/$, which covers our processing costs per item. This 12 \u00a3\/\u20ac\/$ payment can easily be made via bank transfer using the following details:\n\nBank: Cr\u00e9dit du Nord\nIBAN: FR76 3007 6020 2017 1439 0020 058\nAccount Number: 17143900200\nBIC Code: (Bank Identifier Code) NORDFRPP\n\nIMPORTANT: Please ensure that the bank transfer description includes the item reference number and your surname and first name, as indicated on your Vestiaire Collective account.\n\nOnce you have made the payment, please send us proof of the transaction.

To this point I had found it a very pleasant experience both buying and selling.  The platform was easy to use and Vestiaire reliable and easy to contact when needed. It saddens me to say that this has all changed and left me totally frustrated.  I no longer have confidence to either buy or sell on Vestiaire. I am on the verge of removing all my items if this isn't suitably resolved soon.\nI had a sale of two items to the same person on 30 July.  I sent the two items in two separate packages (as we are told to do) on the same day to the same drop off point. This is the first time I have had experience with Hermes and this is where the problem started.\nOne item arrived on 3 August.  The other item arrived on 21 August.  Meanwhile, the buyer and I were both unsuccessfully trying to track down the missing parcel. Hermes are impossible to get in contact with a human being and by phone, it's a useless (bot) or online, the same message kept coming up saying the \"item is in progress - we are sorry your parcel has been delayed, we'll have it on the move in the next 24 hours).  To this day, the message is the same.\nHowever, the buyer messaged me on 21 August to say it had just been delivered.  I think because Hermes didn't sign it off, I have NOT been paid.  \nDuring all this time, the buyer and myself were trying to get in touch with Vestiaire for advice, support and to let them know my experience with Hermes and I have only been able to get a bot with takes my name and email address and NEVER gets back to me.  \nI have spent so much time on this it isn't worth my time and effort for not much money either on the sale.  I can't go through this for every future sale.  It leaves me feeling really let down and frustrated, lacking confidence in the process and needless to say, out of pocket.  Vestiaire are paid, the buyer had her item and I am left with nothing. I would like to be paid.\nI am interested to see whether and how this will be resolved and what's for the future. This was an unpleasant experience for both myself and the buyer. Why is it now impossible to have contact with Vestiaire.  It is a pity that I am reduced to having to deal with this, here. I am hoping that I can write on here that all has been resolved and back to normal.","title":"WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO VESTIAIRE?","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=44&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-09-18","author":"EM","text":"Stay away as SELLER !! and Buyer! Thats all I can say.\n\nI have been a professional seller for almost a year now, at the same time VC has been spiraling down. I used to be a private seller with no issues in 2020 with expert status and everything. But when 2021 started things became a disaster. I don't even know where to start and what to tell. I keep it short - their verification process in the beginning failed to get me a huge sum of sale payments for several weeks. Two expensive handbags were mysteriously lost in their warehouse or on the way. Half of my products, that are authentic (as a reseller we check carefully beforehand) are declared as counterfeit and at the same time I see plenty of fakes on the platform, even confirmed sales. Items returned to me - as apparently \"fake\" - did not arrive in the state I shipped them in - they looked used, thrown into the box. Also their 12 Euro fee to receive returns is a joke - especially as they are the ones who seem not to be able to authenticate. \nThe customer services is awful, they write an essay before they get to the actual topic! Problem solving should be fast- with them it takes ages.\nRecently I sold a pair of brand new designer earrings- 10 days after the buyer receives these earrings they open a return quest- earrings!!!- these cant be tagged and protected- so the buyer can totally wear, clean and return them. the same goes with their great idea of direct shipping - buyer receives items and could potentially wear the item for 14 days before the return deadline is over. I had to buy my own tags to add to my items so buyers cannot fraud me. Even the flimsy tags Vestiaire attaches to their sold products can easily be re-attached. \nWhere is the seller protection??\n\nAlso, I sold a bag the item was shipped on the last day of their period. I informed them and buyer. they cancelled the sale the next day saying item is not shipped. Buyer was ok with receiving a bit later as they were on holiday.
