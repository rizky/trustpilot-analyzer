I happened to be leaving to spend time away over Easter and didn\u2019t have time to print the shipping label so when it came to sending the parcel I wrote the address out manually and sent it. I told Vestiaire collective I had done this and they just cancelled the sale without waiting to find out if it was all fine.

However, this has not be the case.\n\nI first learned of this problem with the Sellers shipping (address not recognised) and was told nothing could be done about the problem until after 21-days of purchase. I believe that this response is unfair because of the lack of professionalism and conflicting timelines given since the issue began.\n\nI would like confirmation from you explaining Vestiaire Collective\u2019s position on my refund and what you will do about my complaint.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible to resolve this problem.","title":"Hello Francheska Mari A,","stars":1,"location":"SA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=1&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-08","author":"Egle Vilunaite","text":"Commission is a rip off !
