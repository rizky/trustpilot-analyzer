Firstly, as a buyer its been remarkably its been trouble free.  However, as a seller its been a total nightmare! Vestiaire appear only to be interested in their buyers, and offer very little, if no support, to their sellers despite the fact that they take sizeable commission from each item you sell.  I have had buyers wear and worse still damage my designer items, then return the goods and Vestiaire immediately refund them their money, before you have a chance to report back as to the condition your returned items were received back in.    It's been an uphill battle.   The final straw has been trying to get them to send me a shipping label after their system failed.  So far I have spent 5 hours on the case and each time I contact them I get fobbed off with no solution in sight.\nIf you have the patience of a saint and money to waste on you designer items, then this is the site for you.

First she said \u201c I am happy to tell you that this return has been accepted\u201c. Wow, \u201cwhat a good service\u201d - I thought. I sent the item back to them.

And NOT from Vestiaire, that I will receive a package sending from Vestiaire on the next day. \n\nNo NOTIFICATION, no EXPLANATION. \n\nAfter I received the bag, I contacted the customer service again and ask them \u201cWhy did you send back the item to me without any notification?\u201d Should I deserve an explanation? \n\nThen I received an answer that they checked the bag and it is the same as the seller\u2019s description. WOW. Where on earth stated in the description that the bag was damaged?????? \n\nI sent them the photo of the description, and asked them to show me. Where, where did they see that the seller wrote these problems? \n\nThey asked me to send the item again for a second check.
