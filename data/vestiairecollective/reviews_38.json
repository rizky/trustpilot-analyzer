The first thing not working was the printing the shipping label. I had to contact customer service three times before I got the shipping label to my emailadress. Once this was sorted I contacted them due to the limited time of shipping in the add. They told me this would not be problem. I shipped the item but because the add had \"run out of time because of delayed shipping\" I could no longer contact the buyer. The buyer received the item on the 11th of October and then within 72 hours I was supposed to get payed. One week later I contacted customer support because I had not been payed. They told me they would look in to it. 4 days later I still hadn't heard anything and contacted them again. This time they said the sale had been cancelled and the buyer had been refunded because the shipping-time had not been prolonged. Customer service told me to they would look in to it but that I next time should contact them to prolong the shipping time. That I had already done from the start!!! So here I am, one month after sale and still not payed, I've had to contact them roughly 6 times. I have never experienced a sale this difficult. It is the first time I have used Vestiare Collective and it will be my last. I cannot recommend anyone to sell through them. Other selling sites are way more convenient (such as eBay, tradera etc). My recommendation is to save yourself the trouble and time and go with another selling-site.","title":"Nothing works!

YES \/ NO\n\nDid you receive a notification of the delivery attempt at your delivery address, or at the post office? (Notice of delivery attempt, an email, or SMS?)

Shipping labels that don\u2019t work, cancelled sales when the reason I hadn\u2019t shipped was because of their own errors, promises to extend the shipping window but then cancelling the sale when the item has already been picked up the courier, unpaid for an item I shipped 2 weeks ago, items rejected for no reason. \n\nOne issue that I actually laughed about was when I sold a sweater to a buyer on the 13th of October and then the sale somehow cancelled itself. I checked the item and the ap stated I cancelled the sale on the 4th of October\u2026 meaning I time travelled and cancelled the sale before it was sold. Vestiaire customer services made out I was crazy and didn\u2019t know how to resolve it. \n\nThe worst one is a pair of trainers I sold 3 times to the same buyer and each time the shipping label didn\u2019t work.

Each time I would relist they would reject my listing claiming it\u2019s not authentic, I would then have to hop back on customer services chat and complain AGAIN and explain AGAIN to someone new.
