[{"date":"2020-12-06","author":"Anonymous","text":"This is a seller appalling experience. This company's standards and customer service support for both sellers and buyers have fallen and are appalling especially considering the high percentage they charge. \nIn brief, I've sold an item, packed it up and arranged a collection with their choice of carrier (and got charged astronomically as obviously they have agreed to have this done only by phone to charge seller premium rate 0844 number) only for the courier not to show up for collection. Then I decide to bring parcel to a drop parcel shop, to be turned away as waybill generated by Vestiaire does not work, is not accepted by carrier's system. After lenghty virtual chat with Vestiaire - as there is no way of contact them otherwise - it looks they have resolved it by sending a new, working aiwaybill. NOT! they just resent the same old one I already had and wasn't working so shipping the goods was not possible all at their own fault and responsability. Sent emails to Vestiaire, which were ignored. Contacted their webchat again where Artie was at hand, ready to NOT help in any way and actually on the ready rude. So no, I am advised there was nothing they could do and as I could not ship because of their inability to make this right and allow me to do so, I would lose the sale as they will cancel it. Lovely. \nThis is what you expect from a concierge service, this is get when paying 40% of your revenues - no help or support, just ready to dismiss a customer and let them incur in a loss and disappoint a buyer waiting for their purchase. Shocking, appalling and pretty disgusting for a company that brags to be the top of the game for service and innovation. Vestiaire, you should look more into your customer service and they way they and you as a company operate as it is clearly a failure. I have sold items on there before, needless to say I have no intention to associate myself with such company anymore and I hope more people research and make better choices when looking at resale companies.","title":"This is a seller appalling experience","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=85&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-12-07","author":"Olena","text":"Where shall I start!!!\nBought Christian louboutin boots ref 32299439 via direct shipping, boots shipped in timely manner by the seller , only to find out boots gone to ups drop off , label provided by vestiaire.

There is a lot of traffic and eventually a buyer is found for most of the pieces. However, more current and brand new pieces are favoured by VC through their \"we love\" system so that there is definitely more preference for professional sellers. But more importantly the customer service is lousy. There is only a chat, which is half AI, half possibly low paid worker who don't care if they solve your issue or not. As a seller you have to be very fast with your shippings. If VC however needs to process something for you, it takes up to a month. And for all of that they take 25-30% and more commission!

In the first sentence \"lightly used\"  has been changed to \"little use\". \n\nThe curators are translating descriptions into French and then making any changes they want. Making a complete mess of descriptions. This is leaving buyers with misleading descriptions and sellers will then be penalised that their item was not as described once it is sold. \n\nI have asked the customer services to change the errors but they cannot seem to do such a simple job, as again they are working in French not in English.\n\nThey are also leaving the descriptions in French on some listings 12368793 and 12265790, which means UK sellers cannot even read their own descriptions on the mobile Ap or have to press translate on their laptops to read and check their own descriptions. This is problematic when you get a question from a buyer, as you cannot even see your own descriptions in English. I have highlighted this problem to customer services but as usual they send out a standard message which does not solve the issue or give you misleading information about changing the overall language of the site, which is not correct.\n\nStop changing the descriptions, UK sellers take time to write their descriptions and do not have time to waste having to write multiple messages to Vestiaire to correct your mistakes in your additions.\n\nBetter still employ people who are multi-lingual and have a good understanding of English so they do not have to translate descriptions into French and start adding their own descriptions.\n\nAnother thing that is becoming very common because of inexperience, the curators they are rejecting perfectly good items so they then have to be listed elsewhere and sold elsewhere.\n\nIf you are a UK seller and have 1 item that the inexperienced curators deem as not conforming, you will loose your conformity rating as they will move it down from 100% to 0%. If you query it they will tell you that it is the algorithm even though algorithms do not work that way, it a change made directly by Vestiaire staff. Algorithms do not discriminate its humans that discriminate. \n\nYou are making Vestiaire a difficult place for UK sellers and they are all having to make sure they are selling in multiple places that give them less stress!","title":"Stop making a mess of item descriptions!!!!","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=85&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-12-08","author":"hee n","text":"Hello Vestiare!\nCons:\n1.i feel the commission is too much so it was hard to sell\n2.
