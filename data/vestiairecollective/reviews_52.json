After Contacting VC about their ridiculous decision to declare my item (previously bought from VC) non-authentic I received an email with the usual blah-blah and \u201cterribly sorry\u201d for the inconveniences and the usual BS. First - it is clear nobody is sorry and second - do not be sorry, just actually do your job properly \u2026 anyway \u2026 so what they do? Instead of fixing their mistake from yesterday, they decide to say that actually their team\nMade a mistake at first place back in 2018 when they sent to me a non-authentic item and they will refund me that order. Very \u201cgenerous \u201c\u2026 but let me tell you why this is a problem:\n\n1\/ because it only shows the total\nLack of any professionalism in this scam\nCompany; the item is authentic, i am a super big Chanel client, i can spot a fake from in a flash and this item is not fake!!!! So, they really do not know what they are doing and this is proven big time again and again.\n\n2\/ for me it is better to get a refund than to actually get the money from the sale as after deduction their commission for them doing nothing but creating messes, i end by getting more money . BUT, Here is the a problem. My buyer is disappointed. I am sure he will never buy from me again because he thinks i am selling fake items - which is actually an authentic item, declared from Vc as fake which three ago was declared from the same Vc as authentic\u2026 totally crazy story. Now i have a disappointed client thanks to VC rubbish \u201cexpert\u201d team \u2026\n\nSo, while keep getting fake apologies and assurances that the matter will be fixed \u2026 and then what happens .?! VC DEPRIVES me of my expert seller badge?!?! WhhhAattt? And why?!?!\nExpert seller - 416 items sold; all shipped on time; all declared comform; all but one - that one which is actually their mistake.\nConclusion- VC is a SCAM COMPANY which is HIGHLY DISCRIMINATORY against knowledgeable sellers. The people who are actually making them money. The people who are wasting hours to deal with their BS. And most probably my geographical\nLocation at the moment rubs them the wrong way. At the end of the day they are french and we all know how some french people\nFeel about foreigners. And as a result they DISCRIMINATE. DISCRIMANATE. DISCRIMINATE. Just to cover their own lack of knowledge and professional and to punish you to for actually noticing and being vocal about their mistakes.\nMy sincere recommendation: use Rebelle and therealreal to sell your items and do not waste your time, nerves and money with this RUDE SCAMMERS. They managed to go BEYOND any worst expectations one might have.\n\nUpdate: VC is like the plague. It keeps destroying whatever it touches. I received a super kind and apologetic email literally informing me that my badge cannot be restored although the mistake of taking it away from me is 100% theirs. But they urge me to sell more \u2026 seriously? Unfortunately when it comes to VC any kind of ridiculousness, unfairness and incompetence is totaly serious.\n\nSecond - the item that i sold and they considered non-authentic which is the item that i originally bought from them in 2018 and then was authentic, is finally refunded to me. BUT?!?! To my original card that i paid with 3 years ago and which is no longer existent and which I actually warned them not to use.\n\nSo, SCAM after SCAM, WRONGDOING after WRONGDOING, DESCRIMINATION after DESCRIMINATION, etc\nOf you want to be dragged through the mud and robbed, VC is the place to get all that.","title":"VC is a discriminatory company","stars":1,"location":"BG","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=52&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-07-24","author":"Maha Aljneibi","text":"i dont even know where to start: \n\nas a buyer: \npurchased a birkin on this website that costs a fortune, vestiaire delivered it to the wrong address and then the courrier company returned it to them, after waiting for 3 weeks for them to ship to the correct address they inform me that they cant locate the item in their warehouse so they will refund me.

The items I sold in Germany go to a collection point in Germany as per their instructions, which depending on when their driver collects and returns to wherever for processing can take a whopping 2 weeks!!! This is before they\u2019ve even checked the item.

Generally, I really like the vision and idea, and strongly support the idea of circular fashion and not throwing away items. BUT - the execution with Vestiaire is horrible and not acceptable given the prestige and COST of the items being bought and sold on their platform. \n\nI thought maybe I had just had some bad experiences but as I read the reviews on here now, I realize that this is definitely a SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM! I have just retroactively reviewed all of my sold item data, and have now identified 7 items (!!!!!!) that their platform does not identify as having been shipped (even though I shipped every single one of item) and hence they have not logged a payment to me. So 7 items, that I bought and owned, shipped and sent to someone... For free! Because Vestiaire inaccurately logs and tracks shipment information and then CANCELS THE SALE and refunds the buyer - even when they receive the items from me! For free. Honestly, it is basically fraud. \n\nI have written them on chat. No response. I have tried contacting various email addresses, no response. The last response I got after managing to chat with a real person (not just a useless BOT) on their chat was in March 2021. I explained the issue and was informed they would raise this with \"the expert team\" and get back to me. Never heard anything again. \n\nI live in Germany and ship items from here and I saw in the reviews that another seller also complained about problems with the tracking of shipments from here. This is clearly an issue that Vestiaire has and that they are not fixing and rather punishing their customers for it. Multiple times, I have sold an items, immediately wrapped it and dropped it off at DHL the next day. Yet, according to the Vestaire platform and app, it is listed as \"Waiting to be shipped\" for days and days, sometimes even beyond the time when the buyer contacts me on chat to say the received the item and love it. It is ridiculous. In the end, I get penalized for \"inconform shipping\" (too late) or they cancel the sale and claim I never shipped it at all. \n\nLike I said, I really like the vision and idea of Vestaire and principle of expert resale but they need to work on their customer service and the general platform they use and stop punishing their customers in the process. It is ridiculous and sad that the only way to get a response from them seems to be public complaints. \n\nSort your stuff out.
