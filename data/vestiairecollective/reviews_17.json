Though I am still waiting on a refund that was granted over a week ago to come through too\u2026 \nStill. Appreciate at least that the company is trying to make amends. My advice, make sure you check the tags on every item you purchase on the site and watch out for buying anything that is listed as wool\/ silk etc. \n\nOriginal review: \nI gave this company another shot after having to send back two products last month that didn\u2019t match the description. I\u2019m still waiting on the refund two weeks after sending back one of the items too\u2026\nBut then I had one good experience, so thought ok, I\u2019ll try again. I purchased a wool Ralph Lauren jumper (listing title was literally that) and the item that arrived was a cotton\/poly mix. I emailed customer support immediately, fairly peeved that once again the item did not match the listing description (if you buy an item because it\u2019s wool, the least you expect is that it arrives with some percentage of wool in it..). I was told that I could not be reimbursed, but I could sell the product on their site for free??? No thanks. The item is not worth the price I paid, because I paid for a wool jumper, not a cheap poly\/ cotton mix. \nI am seriously appalled at this company\u2019s customer service. If a product is listed as made of a certain material, that is the very least a client expects? How can you say this does not warrant a refund? \n\nSo yeah, after all this I have to say, this company is terribly unprofessional and should be avoided. Reading the reviews in every language, one thing sticks out. They are almost ALL terrible. Guys, wake up. Selling products that do not correspond to their description is just so not ok.","title":"Product listings different to what arrives","stars":1,"location":"IT","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=17&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-13","author":"Kafetti","text":"Issue was resolved yesterday after months of accepting my order would never arrive.\nI ordered a couple times from them, no worries.

Dear Vestiaire: I am well aware of import duties. Your response in anyway doesn\u2019t correspond to UK customs import tax threshold which is \u00a3135. If you wish to place any other comments, please make sure they are relevant to UK customs after Brexit legal requirements which I copied in my original review.  They\u2019re are stealing money from UK customers. They add illegal customs fee to the checkout when buying from EU to UK. Below is copied from UK.GOV: You\u2019ll be charged Customs Duty on all goods sent from outside the UK worth more than \u00a3135. \nI wanted to buy item worth \u00a380.I wanted direct shipment without verification from expert seller ( I took this risk on my shoulder). There was no option to opt out of verification fee even if their terms mention that within EU PLUS UK they are not obligatory.  In the end of the checkout I had \u00a315 valuation fee added plus customs \u00a322 (not legal hence why clearly stolen) so in total \u00a337 on top of \u00a380 paid for the item. That is additional 46% cost added, partly illegally added and partly in theory \u201coptional\u201d. I used their verification service few times in the past but the value of the items was much higher so it was worth it. I started chat on their website about it. After spending longer time corresponding with machine I had opportunity to chat with non virtual assistant. I was told that case requires higher management to look into.\nAnd that is the end of the story. I haven\u2019t heard from anyone since then. I am experienced international fashion buyer.

They do not keep to their word, they do not do what they say they are going to do, and you CANNOT trust them at all.
