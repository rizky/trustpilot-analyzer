I have instigated numerous on-line chats and emails to Customer Services and am getting nowhere 3 weeks after payment was allegedly made but \u201cstuck in the system due to a technical error\u2019!!.  I was also told the exceptional circumstances need to be looked into and I am constantly fobbed-off by generic holding emails.  The bottom line is they have not paid me and whatever problem they have at their end is not my concern.  This is despicable business practice and I will seek legal action.  I will never buy or sell via this site again and warn others to stay clear of it.\n\n18 Jan - review edit: Well isn't it amazing that I get a response from Vestiaire Collective on a public review site but cannot get a response from my numerous (c. x20) emails communications to Customer Services and the On Line chat facility involving x7 named operatives!  They all continue to ignore my pleas to be paid and neither have they responded to my emailed proof of not being paid - I attached the relevant bank statement and bank account screenshots of incoming transactions over the expected payment period.  During one of my communications with on-line chat, one of the named operatives apologised that my payment was \u201cstuck in the system due to a technical issue\u201d - so what is their story?.  I have not been paid.  I am owed \u00a3157.50 for for sale of my beautiful Alexander Wang bag.  The buyer has the bag and Vestiaire Collective received the payment from the buyer but I - the seller and Vestiaire Collective\u2019s \u2018bread and butter\u2019 - have not received my due amount of this business transaction.  It\u2019s appalling how much time and effort I have had to put into trying to get paid.  It\u2019s impossible to speak to anyone on the phone so they hide behind e-comms. \nI hope my appalling experience of Vestiaire Collective is a warning to others.\n\nFinal edit\/update - on 31 Jan I was eventually paid the money owed to me since 18 Dec but only after numerous further pleas from me to the On-line Chat facility.  The operative sent me a screenshot confirming payment to the (wrong) ex-bank account which in fact clearly stated \u2018Status - De-activated\u2019 but VC still would not accept they hadn\u2019t paid me (no further mention of the monies \u2018being stuck in the system\u2019).  I had to ask Tesco Bank to write a letter to me confirming no payment had been received, which I scanned & sent to VC.  A week later - after I\u2019d chased up an acknowledgement - VC asked me to delete my (correct) bank account details and re-enter them, even though they had paid into the correct bank account since 18 Dec for a 2nd sale.\nI\u2019ve had no unsolicited contact fro their Customer Services nor an apology. \nI\u2019ve now cancelled my account with Vestiaire Collective.","title":"I am owed \u00a3157.50 from the sale of my\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=24&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-11","author":"Audra Susinskaite","text":"i received this email 1st of december (below)\nit has been almost 1.5 months, i still do not have money in my account... every time i write an email, i get answer from another person, who doesnt bother to read the history of conversation...  \n\n\nIn regards with what happened, receiving an incorrect item from the buyer, we'll ask you to shipped the incorrect item to us (in our warehouse).
