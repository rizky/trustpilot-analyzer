If you don\u2019t know how to run a business, doesn\u2019t matter how much investment money you got, you\u2019re still bound to fail, and this is exactly where Vestiaire Collective is heading, because this company doesn\u2019t value at all customer\u2019s feedbacks and shows no efforts attempting to improve.

It arrives and is damaged with marks to the skin and dirty -clearly it has not passed through their control system. \n\nVC then issued a wrong DHL label, which made DHL loose it in their system for over a month. I had to try to rectify their mistake with countless hours on the phone with DHL. The coat was then wrongly sent to an old address of mine in France (I live in the US). Finally, after 2 months, the coat was with them at VC warehouse in France. They then took over a month to process the return.\n\nI payed the coat in USD, using my a credit card in another currency. Because VC only returned the amount to my account 13\/1\/2021, the dollar had lost its value, and the amount they transferred back to my account was 180 dollars less then what I transferred to them in October 2020. If VC had not 1) lost the coat and then 2) spent months processing their mistake, all this could have been avoided. I've provided them with bank statements and spent literally dozens of hours with customer \"service\" throughout this whole story, and still they will not return the 180 usd. Absolutely horrible experience. \n\nDo not shop here, they do not ensure a quality check, and then steal your money\/do not own up to their mistake. I've been lied to by people at their customer service (saying they'll get back to me on certain dates, and then not doing so, telling me the processing will be done before Christmas), and only when I threatened to report them to Mastercard for fraud did they return my money partially. \n\nSuch a shame, because I've been a faithful enthusiast of VC for many years. But after this experience I'm never endorsing them again. My tip to anyone would be to save yourselves the high blood pressure, and extremely unsecure customer experience, and spend your time and money elsewhere.","title":"How VC stole 180 USD and took 3 months to handle the return of a damaged Chanel coat","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-03","author":"Meerkat","text":"Buyers, be aware that this website sells fakes, and thanks to the option of direct shipping, VC will not even try to authenticate fake items.

The worst part of it all is that VC has re-listed this item already 4 (!!!) times as previous sales have been cancelled. There are over 20 buyers' comments under the item explaining that this item is fake and why it is fake, but VC does not do anything about it.\nSo be careful with items listed just under below USD\/EUR1000 (this is the threshold for direct shipping), if you take the risk with direct shipping, make sure the seller has some sort of history and did not appear just yesterday, and that if something is too good to be true, it is probably best to give it a second thought.","title":"Increased number of fake items listed and sold","stars":1,"location":"CH","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-03","author":"Nicola Marshman","text":"I don\u2019t know where to start other than to say the customer service is absolutely awful.

I\u2019m trying to reach out to their customer team for nearly two weeks now but they deliberately ignoring to look into this case (can you, VC team, send me a return label, check the item again and refund me as it is certainly not in \u2018never worn\/used\u2019 conditions?).\nWhy I say deliberately ignoring: there is another issue which I brought up at the same time and they are responding to it as it does not involve potential refund, yet it should. This other-issue is next:\n\nOrder Ref : 13409079 (\u00a3219.47)\n\nI made this order on 19.12 and received\u2026. On 25.01. I ordered it as a gift for my friend and I thought I bought it ahead of time. I would never think it will take nearly 2 months (!) to get my order. Obviously, I missed the time to give it as a gift, so, I decided to re-list this item in an attempt to get my money back. And guess what? Their \u2018curation\u2019 team says it\u2019s not the item \u2018they would list on their website\u2019. Yes. I bought it from them and they don\u2019t sell such kind of items (yet I saw the identical item was approved a day before and a few days after. I literally have no words). I tried to get a reasonable explanation, yet no specific answer was given to why you sell, \u2018authenticate\u2019 but don\u2019t accept it for sale.\n\nSo, the drama goes on.\nI contacted their team in attempt to re-list the item not as new one but as the one which I purchased on their web\u2019 (e.g. their IT team just relocate the item from a seller name to my name). And, their customer team replied (the proof they are selective to what to reply), saying, yes, we can re-list it this way.\nSo.\nI was in touch with 3 different representatives (the current one is Jack) who cannot resolve the issue (the other two just stopped replying\/updating me on resolving the issue). The item is visible to their IT team and it\u2019s shown in my \u2018submitted\u2019 items but it\u2019s neither among my items for sale nor can be found when searching for this type of items. I repeated the issue all three times with details and multiple screenshots, showing that the item is not listed and not actually visible to buyers. I even had to explain them to log off and go to my items for sale and see it from the buyer\u2019s perspective, this item is not there.\n\nSo, all this in my very sad attempt to get my money back and they are not even trying to help anyhow. In both cases.\n\n\nTO VC TEAM: \n1.\tCan you send me a return label for the faulty item (Ref : 13635752), so your team will see it\u2019s certainly not as it was listed\/described and refund?\n2.\tWhy your \u2018curation\u2019 team does not accept items for sale which were purchased on your website?\n3.\tCan your \u2018curation\u2019 team accept the item to be listed on your website as a new item, not as relisting from a previous seller as it\u2019s obvious that neither your CS team nor IT team know how to do it (which I purchased on your website, Ref : 13409079), so I can try to get my money back?\n\n\nIf this website (trustpilot) allows, I will certainly post an update on those issues.","title":"Very bad","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-02-03","author":"Kamila Harris","text":"I would strongly advise you NOT to buy anything from Vestaire if you live in the UK and the item is coming from another country.
