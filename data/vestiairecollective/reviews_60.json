I mailed my item to Vestiaire at the end of March and still hadn\u2019t heard anything back from them, it\u2019s now May 3. It turns out FedEx still has my item and the buyer has not collected it (or obviously, paid for it).Vestiaire obviously was not keeping track of this. If I had not called them they would not be reaching out to FedEx to see if my item is still available to be returned to me! Apparently for me to request removing \u201cdirect shipping\u201d from my account entirely requires a review by \u201cthe experts\u201c at Vestiaire. Please see attached chats fir frustrating experience of trying to get info from this company.\nI have been using Vestiare for several years now and it\u2019s gotten progressively worse in terms of policies and customer service (For example, one day I looked at my account to find out that all my items listed for sale had been erased! They apologized but I still had to upload pictures again etc). It\u2019s especially bad as a place to try to sell items \u2014 Which makes sense because their commission is on drumming up lots of sales.\nI just realized this is a Vestiaire-run review, so I doubt this will appear.

No reply then rejected my item as non- compliance.. this is fine as this is highly subjective but why let me submit the item at the first place since you are clearly lack of expertise in the field you are in.
