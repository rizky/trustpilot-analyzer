They cannot be trusted. \nI recently bought a Gucci bag, upon its arrival it was much smaller than I expected so I went back onto the site to double-check the original listing. When I did this I found two listings using identical photos (both listings even had a photo of the bag with the same serial number) One was the bag I had bought and the other is a bag sold to someone else. Seeing this immediately made alarm bells ring ( how is this possible? do they not check the listings before?! Surely two listings with IDENTICAL photos show something fishy is going on?!). I had a look at some other listings for the same bag, of which all had different dimensions and different lining material. I then researched the bag online only to find that Gucci has never made a bag with these dimensions. I raised my concerns with customer service who instructed me to send that bag back to their head office. Once it arrived at their head office I was informed it has passed their \"verification checks\" within less than 24 hours (obviously not a very thorough check) and would be shipped back to me. No-body would answer my concerns and every person I contacted via customer service gave me a template answer. Doubting they even have real people working in customer service. The bag has now been returned to me (I have had to pay customs charges yet again) and I still have no proof that this bag is legitimate. I asked for answers time and time again only for all of my requests and questions to be ignored. All the evidence I have found proves this bag is fake. I wish I had checked their reviews online before making this purchase as it seems they are not a company who can be trusted. I am now out of pocket with only a crappy fake bag to show for it.
