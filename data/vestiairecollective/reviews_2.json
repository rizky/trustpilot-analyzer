In this case their automatic system where you have to upload the docs doesnt accept a purchase bill. I did sent one from Decathlon, proving where I am staying right now. My mobile bill is from my previous country and obviously doesnt coincide with my passport either. They have no right to ask me that my address coincides with my passport or my bills, I move around a do change my address quite often. In fact I am going to live off-grid next month and I wont have gas or tel bills no more.\nSo they have built a security system that fails and it is illegit but I have to pay the price for it because when it comes to complains they make everything really difficult, a labyrith, so you give up. They redirect also every complain to a help center and in my case its been a month and they have not even answer, on top they dont give you a case reference number when you put the complain.\nThey keep on sending me an automatic email, with a non-reply, asking for these documents, as it is my fault and the ball is on my roof.\nI have asked to at least get my handbag back with no success.\n\nLaura B.

But there should be some transparency here. There is a whole section in customer service that displays the shipping fees at each case, depending on the buyer's and seller's location or the type of shipping you chose. What's the point of these tables if the fees you really have to pay have nothing to do with them. I purchased 2 items over the last 2 weeks. One from an EU country to Greece and one from Greece to Greece. At both times I was asked to pay the exact same amount of 11\u20ac for shipping fees while at the relative link mentions 10\u20ac for shipping in the EU and 6\u20ac for local shipping. That's not right. There is a \"from\" next to the shipping rate. Does this justify it all? I searched for anything that could explain such an amount and the only thing I could find was customs which of course don't apply within the same country. 11\u20ac is too expensive for local shipping. There should be clarity and there should be some sort of customer service. I contacted customer service and they told me sorry nothing I can do. It's not about the amount of money you have to pay.

Just a stock standard reply from a customer care agent.\n\nAs a long time eBay customer and professional seller, I have to express my utter disappointment with the service received from Vestiaire. \n\nI purchased a Chanel handbag on the proviso that Vestiaire would take care of me should anything go wrong with the transaction. The bag was listed in the \u2018very good condition\u2019 category which I soon realised is not at the grading standards one would expect when buying Chanel. \n\nThe bag arrived with visible oxidisation on the chain strap which was NOT declared by the seller. The bag also arrived without a serial number (!!) which too was NOT declared by the seller. \n\nI reported both issues to Vestiaire and sent supporting photos to which they agreed to reassess the bag a second time.\n\nAfter I had to follow up 3 times to get an update, I was informed the bag was fine and that I wouldn\u2019t be refunded. Vestiaire\u2019s explanation was that it is a very old bag and was produced before serial numbers existed. Wouldn\u2019t one think that this vital piece of information should be declared on the listing? Even the quality of the photos that Vestiaire approved left much to be desired.\n\nVestiaire then proceeded to relist the bag on my account without informing me first and it was sold for hundreds of dollars less than what I had paid. So the poor customer who is now buying this bag (and may not care about the issues I\u2019ve highlighted), may end up with a cancelled sale because of poor communication on VC\u2019s end. Either that or VC will proceed with the sale against my wishes and I am left hundreds of dollars out of pocket.\n\nI had to go through the exhausting task of contacting their customer service team for the umpteenth time via chat (which if you have done this before, you will know requires much patience and effort as you never get to chat to the same person twice and have to explain the entire situation over), only to have them pass on my message to another member of the team, to then get back to me via email. No opportunity to have a two way dialogue because of a very poor customer service platform.\n\nSo here I am, trying to figure out how on earth to move forward after spending many hours without a resolution. I\u2019ve had to escalate my issue to PayPal.\n\nMy honest opinion is not to waste your time and energy, the service is sub par and you are treated like a number.\n\nDo better Vestiaire, your customers deserve better.","title":"Disappointing to say the least","stars":1,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=2&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-04","author":"Zharkyn Ermekovna","text":"I have been an experienced seller on Vestiaire for many years and never had any issues with this platform until I had sold my Alexander McQueen trainers Ref: 22178605, which the authentication team checked them and stated that they are not authentic, I thought that the people who work for the authentication made a mistake and asked for the second review and again same result, I am absolutely shocked how they can state that the shoes which I bought in Harvey Nichols can be fake?
