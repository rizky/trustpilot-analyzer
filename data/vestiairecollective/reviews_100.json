Thank you for that! Because of this I'm updating my star rating. I will still leave it at three stars though because I think their staff should be better trained, and it shouldn't take a review like this to get their attention. Good luck everyone!\n\n\nReally crappy experience. I bought a counterfeit Realisation Par dress by accident on their website (from an Expert Seller, mind you!) and got in touch by their online form the day I received it, with pictures. When days went by with no response, I wrote via their app's chat feature, which worked (at least on the surface). A representative got in touch quickly and told me they had never received my contact form requests. Great! I would have waited forever not knowing what happened. He said he submitted my request himself and that they would be in touch later. Again, days pass with no further contact. I got in touch again via chat, and a different representative told me a prepaid return label had already been uploaded to my account. While I would have appreciated being informed about this in the first place, I thought fine, at least this will be over soon. The representative told me to let them know by email or chat once the return had been shipped, and they would process my refund. Finally some relief! Except it wasn't. I shipped the item and got in touch to let them know, as requested, but instead received very confusing messages from a person who couldn't type and could barely speak English. They said they were \"investigating my issue\" which made no sense since previously I was told that all I would need to do is inform them of my return. Anyway, fine, she said she would get back to me later via email. And then... crickets. Are you sensing a theme here? \n\nFinally, today, I got in touch again to ask what the hell is going on with my return and was met with a very snippy representative who told me that their team will need 14 days after the item arrives to decide whether or not it really is a counterfeit. !!!!!!\n\nOn the bright side, finally, a representative who knows how their return service works! Who is training these people?? At the same time, I now have to wait two more weeks to see if they're at all honest (not much faith at this point), and the person who sold me the fake gets to go on with their jolly lives (oh yeah, I asked, they don't ban sellers who sell fakes!). Seems fair and intelligent, right? Especially for a luxury resale company? This is why every third Realisation dress you see is a knockoff, if not more. They don't even have a feature to report obviously inauthentic pieces--it's apparent whose side they're on in this.\n\nDO NOT TRUST VESTIAIRE. If you absolutely have to use them, at least pay by Paypal so you're covered by Buyer Protection. I have half a mind to contact my bank, but will wait until they respond to me (God knows when).\n\nTruly pathetic.","title":"Crappy experience - but they helped in the end","stars":3,"location":"ES","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=100&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-08-25","author":"Patricia Boswell","text":"I use the site for the first time and brought a Loewe bag for \u00a3167.00 the picture of the showed like it was a normal size handbag when it arrived it was the smallest bag ever.

I have been a seller of luxury goods since 2008 and it's vestiaire who contacted me asking if I would like to sell on their platform. I don't even know where to start with frustration I've had by being part of this. Firstly, there is a definite favourism towards some sellers who can sell an utter garbage on the site, but all their items no matter how bad the quality - get accepted. I've had items that are brand new and classic pieces that one could wear for years get rejected as they apparently \"do not fit\" their online catalogue. It doesn't take long to realise by looking at the online catalogue that this simply is not the case. The irony is that the moment I have listed these very same items on ebay  they have sold in short space of time. So no real financial loss here, but they just don't respect your time it takes to list the items and could not care less about it. Secondly, there is no seller protection and the users can make offers on items never actually purchasing the items after the offer has been accepted with zero consequences. Thirdly, there simply is not enough traffic and one is definitely better off selling on ebay. I could go on and on, but not sure whether there is actually anything that is going to change purely judging from the quality of their support staff who can never actually help and seem to have a deaf ear.","title":"Not impressed as a long term seller","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=100&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-08-28","author":"Spiders Stars","text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I purchased Marine Serre tattoo top which turned out to be a knock-off despite their so called quality control and authentication process which we pay extra for. On the website the top looked like the real thing but thankfully I have the same top in a smaller size which does not fit me and is the reason I bought this top in a bigger size. Upon comparison you can see the stark differences between the fake they sent me and the real thing. Aside from difference in color, fabric and graphics, clear evidence that the top sent to me is a fake is the fact that the inner tag of the fake one sent to me says SS19, while the real one says SS20. The Tattoo Top was exclusive to the SS2020 collection and wasn\u2019t even created in 2019.  I tried sending them pictures and my refund request but none of it ever went through. Seeing this, I tried talking with their help desk to obtain a direct email but was told one did not exist.  I am very disappointed that the Vestiaire team who charges a fee to inspect item\u2019s authenticity and has seen many Marine Serre products could not tell this is a fake!  The top sent is 100% a knock-off. What\u2019s more, the fact that you can\u2019t even reach out to them and get a refund is beyond ridiculous. Don\u2019t believe their so called \u201cVestiaire Guarantee\u201d that if an item is non-compliant they will reimburse you for the whole cost. By not even making it possible for a customer to get a refund on a fake item that was sent to them, they are complicit in the selling of fakes!","title":"If I could give zero stars I would","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=100&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
