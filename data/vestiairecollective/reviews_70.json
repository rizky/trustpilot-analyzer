I did this and I was right I had been sent an incorrect address label and a new one was issued to France and was collected by UPS. The item was received and even though it was brand new with labels and I took photos before sending as I have had a problem before with this company stating brand new items with labels are defective on receipt they claimed there was a fault. I was given the chance to accept the drop in price and as I wanted rid of any dealings with this company any further I accepted via their app and in a further email I received. Their app and link in their email is clearly not working as I have just been told they are waiting to hear from me and not to keep the buyer waiting.
