In my most recent order (of five items) I had two items that never shipped, and a third that came as a size EU 42 despite being listed and described as an EU 30. I was able to make contact and resolve the shipping issue, but have had no luck trying to get a customer service response about my mis-sized item. It wasn't a very expensive piece, so it's not a crisis, but I feel a little uncomfortable.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for your reply. Upon revisiting the listing I do see that there is a note in the comments section of the & other stories dress indicating that it is a size EU 42, and one of the several pictures does show the tag -- but it is referred to at several other points, including both 'main' descriptions (i.e. the listing and the item description), as a size EU 30. I appreciate that this is somewhat ambiguous, but still feel the listing was extremely misleading. I am also a bit uncomfortable with the way this was handled and disappointed that I had to make a public post in order to get a customer service response.","title":"Shady order experience","stars":1,"location":"IE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=36&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-02","author":"AB","text":"You guys are B corporated?

I am living in the UK and the seller was located in the UK too. I contacted Vestiaire to find out whether there would be custom fees to have the bag authenticated (authentication is in France) and they said there wouldn't, so I went ahead with the authentication process. When the bag arrived, I was charged nearly \u00a350 in custom fees (1\/4th of the price of the bag). But the worst part is that the so-called \"authentication process\" didn't even detect that the seller had advertised wrong measures for the bag. Therefore, I received an item which was a different size from the advertised size, even though I spent \u00a350 for the authentication process. I don't know who is in charge of the authentication but I would have expected as a bare minimum that basic features of a bag (size, colour, etc) would be checked thoroughly. Very disappointing considering the price I paid for this and the fact that I was wrongly advised on custom fees. Would not recommend.\n\nEDIT after seeing the reply: The link they sent does not direct to a form.

I have been a VC customer for a while and bought and sold many items. Recently I bought a classic Balmain blazer. However when it arrived it was clear that it had been substantially altered by a tailor. I have multiple of these blazers in the same size so I can compare the cut, fit and the stitching. The seller has had this blazer taken apart and put back together much smaller and the seems and the back and arms clearly prove this. This is easily visible by looking at the stitching on the arms and back of the blazer they are no longer where they should be!!!!! Therefore this is no longer an AUTHENTIC item. The overall size is now 1-2 sizes smaller and the blazer does not sit properly as the shoulders have also been cut and restitched plus the arms are around 8cms shorter. I sent multiple messages and emails with photos attached showing the cut and stitching of the blazer compare to different original balmain blazers so they can see the proof of the major alterations. But I just got a generic email back saying the item matches the sellers description. However surely the seller has a duty of care to say if an item has been severely changed from its original state?! The is false advertising and I have been mis sold an item as \u201coriginal\u201d and being a certain size. The item was even sent back for authentication but clearly they did not check back against my photos or emails as when I followed up it was like they were getting the information for the first time. I then had someone on instant chat ask to call me I said yes then gave them my phone number then they closed the chat, never called and just sent the same generic email again \u201cthe item matches the seller\u2019s description\u201d. That is NOT what I am arguing. Yes the pictures match but the seller has been operating under false pretenses. The seller can not resize and change the cut and fit of an item and say that it is original and very good condition! This is not like a dress has been made a little shorter, the entire shape, size, cut and fit has been changed.

It was in perfect condition as I had just purchased it and the only reason I was selling it was because it was too big for me. Vestiaire\u2019s quality control team rejected my item saying there was a hole in it. I was shocked and asked for proof. They sent a photo with a huge hole by the collar line. And that\u2019s where this awful and alarming quality of service issue began.\n\nFollowing news that my brand new item had been rejected due to a hole, I contacted Vestiaire\u2019s customer support team by the app, each time you first get a generic robot and then eventually when the robot can\u2019t answer your questions, a person, but even that option of chatting with a person gives you generic responses, I know this because each time with a seperate person they would make the exact same grammatical mistake to offer to send me an email, so it must be a response they are copy pasting. They were not helpful, each time they would just say they were looking into it with their quality control team and would come back to me, but after over 1 week I still had no news, and had to keep following up via a new chat.\n\nWhat\u2019s also alarming is once the customer support rep is finished chatting with you, Vestiaire removes all records of chats with them in their application, this means not only that each time you speak to a representative you have to start from scratch but also you have no proof of what you have communicated to Vestiaire and what they have sent back to you unless you screenshot the chat. I learned that you can request them to provide you a reference number for your chat for them to look up internally but they will not send you those records.\n\nUltimately while I was appalled that Vestiaire\u2019s quality control team had damaged my brand new item, what was really upsetting me is they were blaming me for it, and I had no way to contest that further even though I sent them photos as proof that the item clearly had no hole when I sent it. I just wanted a refund and my item returned.\n\nVestiaire\u2019s delivery service declared it was not possible to deliver my item back to me (I still don\u2019t understand why) and shipped it back to Vestiaire who are refusing to give it back to me and issue me a refund for the issue. The last email I received from their customer support was that their quality control assures me it was not made by their teams. I asked them if they have cameras and if they could send me the footage as proof. They do have cameras but they do not want to send me the footage. Also who controls and provides the judgement on if their quality control team is correct, well their quality control team, this is basic compliance and risk 101 the team that is carrying out the service should not be the ones responsible for if deciding if that service is good, otherwise obviously they will always say it\u2019s great, and in my case not take responsibility for a mistake they have made.\n\nFinally it\u2019s been more than 2 weeks since I have been writing them, they want to keep the sweater with a hole in it to try to relist the item on their site and provide me 20\u20ac as a gesture but clearly not admitting it was their fault. I\u2019m exhausted and feel like I have no choice but to accept this offer as it\u2019s not worth it for me to waste my time to get the money of that, it\u2019s more a question of trust and the principle of it. I told them I would accept, and since then no news of how this 20\u20ac will be given to me, they have stopped responding\u2026\n\nSellers beware, luckily in my case it\u2019s an inexpensive h&m sweater that was brand new with the tags, but I would be much more weary and nervous for bigger ticket items and if it wasn\u2019t new, because that gives them a lot more margin in their errors or mistreatment of goods. I don\u2019t think they do it intentionally but I imagine they try to do it factory line style and industrialize this process to make it efficient, which means not always treated with care. Also I have heard stories of how their quality control team doesn't always correctly spot fakes, this doesn\u2019t surprise me with the experience that I have had. \n\nSo then that begs the question what are we paying all that extra money to them for. I\u2019m all for second hand but grand, but better use sites like Vinted whose customer service is very good (I had an issue with one article in the past and they resolved it quickly and efficiently finding an amical solution for me and the seller) and who doesn\u2019t charge you exorbitant fees for \u2018supposed\u2019 quality control which in the end risks doing more damage than good.\n\nIn this spirit I opted to delete all articles that I was selling from Vestiaire and sell on sites like Vinted and Depop instead as I really dont trust Vestiaire Collective\u2019s quality control from my experience.\n\nUpdate: since posting I recieved a notification saying 20\u20ac was being paid to me by VC.","title":"Vestiare\u2019s quality control damaged my brand new sweater and says it\u2019s my fault","stars":1,"location":"FR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=36&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-06","author":"CS","text":"How stupid of me after already having a terrible customer experience on Vestiaire collective that I would foolishly buy from them again and guess what another absolutely terrible experience!!!!!
