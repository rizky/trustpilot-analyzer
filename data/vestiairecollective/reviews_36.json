I was told after 21-days would receive a full refund as VC is insured and the refund will be automatically refund to my account. Item has not been refunded by VC.

On two occasions I have been sent bags which are NOT authentic despite them charging me for \u201cauthenticity\u201d. \n\nThe first one was a YSL bag and it was SO obvious that it was a fake. I sent it back and they accepted it was fake and refunded. Just to give you an idea - there was no brand stamping on the zips and hardware and it just looked so cheap. \n\n The second one was a Celine vintage bag. It wasn\u2019t even a good fake! It was so amateur! What are these \u201cauthenticity experts\u201d doing? I sent it back and they think it matches the standards? The Celine logo wasn\u2019t even straight! The logo tag was an odd uneven shape!! The hardware wasn\u2019t brand stamped or metal! Soooo amateur! The leather isn\u2019t even real leather. Anyone who knows designer bags and has owned them could tell. I think it\u2019s so they don\u2019t have to admit that they\u2019ve done this to me AGAIN! They either don\u2019t care and want sales or their authenticity experts are not very effective.\n\nExtremely disappointed with this recent \u201creview\u201d and I urge everyone to be really wary when buying from them as there\u2019s a lot of people trying to sell fakes on there. \n\nI\u2019ve got ALL the photos and all the proof.

I paid \u00a3282. After using the handbag a few weeks, I noticed that a part of it had fallen off and when I checked closer I noticed that the leather connecting to the hardware was reinforced with cardboard (which was now tearing off in pieces). I then checked the serial number online and it was confirmed as a fake. I sent detailed information to customer service and they told me to return it and the authentication team would check it again. \nThey confirmed the handbag as real! Refusing to refund it they said they would relist it for sale! I said I would report them to Trading Standards for knowingly selling counterfeit items so am now pursuing a refund that route and through my credit card company.
