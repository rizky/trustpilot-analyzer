So I raised an authenticity claim to Vestiaire, they immediately accepted to review it again. After a couple of days, they sent me an e mail saying that I'll receive a full refund. Until then, everything was kind of OK, people make mistakes, BUT then I noticed that they uploaded the bag on the site again (Vestiaire was the \"seller\" in this case) and then I noticed it was sold it with 25% discount. \nHow can you resell a bag that you know its fake and you have confirmed that to other buyer? \nI really hope this review helps to make people aware that Vestiaire is not fully trustable and you have to carefully review your item as soon as you receive it.\nI also hope that the person that bought this bag (grey with fuccia accents), review it carefully before accepting it!","title":"VC confirmed bag as fake, then put on sale again","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=64&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-01","author":"Tina","text":"I sold an item in new condition.

A couple of items sat in quality control for weeks, causing a disgruntled buyer to contact me and eventually I spent hours trying to rectify the situation.  As I observed, the buyer's process is also an issue as noted by several of my buyers.  With the example below, it literally took me at least 5 communications and ~3 months to receive my money for a blouse, which was clearly marked as shipped by Fed Ex, yet VC didn't seem to believe the item was shipped to the buyer and despite the tracking information validating the delivery, they waited for the buyer to approve receipt vs documents submitted by their \"trusted seller\".\n\nApril 4, 2021\nRe: Expert vs Trusted Seller\n\nI'd like to escalate my message to a supervisor, as this is not the first time I am contacting VC as a disgruntled seller.

According to the policy I am I am due to be an expert seller ad as I reviewed my stats, the sales\/conformity stats are not accurate.  For instance, I sold a Dolce & Gabbana blouse earlier in the year and it was not credited for 3 months as the shipping and delivery system does not seem to indicate real-world accuracy.  It literally took me at least 5 communications and ~3 months to receive my money as VC didn't seem to believe the item was shipped to the buyer and despite the tracking information validating the delivery.  I have countless other issues in which the \"quality team mishandled my items, many of which were worth thousands of dollars.   In doing the math and tallying the statistics,  I am due to be an expert seller (months ago) and would like to understand why this is not reflected in my profile.   I'm going to deal with one issue at a time but the VC model is subpar to many of its competitors and has caused me to halt on uploading 100s of items I have in inventory.","title":"Too many issues re: Horrible seller experience","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=64&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-05","author":"Cyrus","text":"I just started to sell some items on Vestiare and it did \nnot work well at all.

Items such as 3000$ Bottega Veneta bags or 2000\u20ac Max Mara coats from the best replicas factories are being sold on VC and they just do not care. They are replicas of brands such as orseund Iris, realisation, zimmermann, dion lee, nanushka, ganni, alexander wang, isabel marant, off white, self project, maison margiela, loewe, and many many more - all those people sell those items and their quality team thinks that they aren\u2019t fakes of these brands and accept everything. I offered them my help, to join the team to help solving the replicas problems but they do not care. So I\u2019m going to expose them. Here\u2019s a list of profiles where people sell only counterfeit items from best replicas sellers (they got the info from Reddit from fashionreps or repladies) : ask these sellers for proof of purchase of anything - You won\u2019t get any. \n@elera9686101 - over 120 fake items \n@noah11371357 - 50 items sold and 30 for sale. This girl is selling fakes for two years and has multiple accounts - when I contacted VC a year ago about it they confirmed it and deleted all the accounts, but she keeps getting new and i report them and they dont care. \n@filippapepp - also her account, here she\u2019s selling a lot of bottega Veneta bags without invoice etc obviously fake and they accept it!!\n@staplefindsuk - another fake seller\n@tsf - 62 items sold. 150 for sale she\u2019s even \u201eproffesional seller\u201d. She even uses pictures from Chinese rep sellers - try image searching them on Google and see what you\u2019ll find. \n@oceanbeyond - fake bags, same story with photos taken from replicas sellers\n@omega10951801 - fake items all of them\n@alexander9983054 - 50 replicas sold, some worth over 2000\u20ac I think they banned this account but I doubt they refunded and contacted every single buyer. \n@wendy5863 - all items are fake. \n@marcin12175320 - all fake so bad fakes. \n@julia10989919 same person as above\n@michal8272504 same person as above\n@wojtek9726526 same person as above\n@kacper11182107 same person as above\nAnd they are many more.
