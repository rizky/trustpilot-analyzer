Your staff Julie, told me that: \n\nOn 10 Aug 2021 - \n\"I am getting back to you regarding the sale of your Bulgari ring reference 14072127. \n It has now been relisted on your account under the new reference 17449929.

On 18 Aug, I realised 14072127 disappeared (your Vanessa now blames me for deleting it), and I tried to contact your company by email on the same day, but no reply was received. I tried to seek help from online staff, I remembered that they told me they could not relist it. It turns out I could do nothing, I relied on Julie\u2019s words that that my original item 14072127 was listed as 17449929, and I could write to your company once it is sold for a refund of commission.\n\n17449929 was subsequently sold on 29 Sep 2021. Immediately after that, I chatted with your staff Christina online, she asked me to rest assured that the commission will be refunded to me after the payment is made.

The email was followed up by Vanessa. I sent her all sorts of written records, despite my explanation, she insisted that the item was deleted by me as a seller.

As a seller, I haven't faced any particular problems with selling or buying, and the payments always go through. My problem with Vestiaire Collective is its customer support. Firstly, I recently tried to list some amazing special designs of Bottega Veneta clutches. The first one was accepted because it had a special tag of it being a limited edition item. The other two, which were also rare designs needed more photos to authenticate. Vestiaire Collective was asking me to post a photo of their serial numbers (inside the clutch), but Bottega Veneta clutches do not have a serial number attached on the clutch (or did not have when I bought them). It is a pity for Vestiaire, which is considered to be a luxury item reseller to not know how to authenticate common luxury items and ask for something which should not be there. Secondly, as a buyer, I have tried to buy a lovely dress(and the seller was Vestiaire Collective), so I thought everything would be easier as it is the most trusted seller on the platform. After all of my offers were rejected and all my questions about its condition remained unanswered by the VestiaireCo seller (which apparently does not want to participate in its own procedures) I added the item to my basket. Even though the item (with a tag on it) was already at Vestiaire and had already been authenticated, and while I live in Greece, I was required to pay 20 EUR for shipping and authentication. I ended up not buying because I tried to discuss why the Shipping Cost was so much higher since direct shipping is free but Customer Support was not helpful once again. On the contrary, whenever a review is made here, Vestiaire Collective is very helpful and always has a solution. I trust that you will contact me and help me with the problem. Thank you in advance\nUPDATE: A member from the Customer Service team got in touch with me to let me know that they will reconsider posting my 2 items, and an hour later my items were posted without asking for further information!

Bought a LV bag in what was listed good condition and the authenticator did not spot 4 tears in canvas in it. When I received a bag ( and spotted the damage within 30 seconds )  and raised an issue with VC ( as there was no information on tears to canvas on the photos or description) they offered to recheck it. Again, the authenticator decided that the bag matches the description ( please do show me how it matches the description and photos which do not mention or show damage to canvas and your own grading system shows that good condition means no tears???). Then they sent me an email offering that they will relist it ( and take commission of course) or they can send it back to me. I decided to take it back, of which I informed them and exactly followed the steps as they told me. And now almost a week later another support agent comes back saying \" upon review of our return policy if the return was complaint we will relist it\". I was clearly offered a return and now they decided to relist it and take a commission. Just to make sure I will be out of pocket for their incompetent behaviour. Genuinely shocking and disappointing customer service, but also authenticators who seems to have no clue how to check the bag. So here we are 20 + days after I bought the item, with no bag and or money refunded.  Item 18019568\n\nUPDATE: Things escalated quickly when overnight they re -listed the bag without my consent and without reading my emails with attachments which prove that I clearly was offered a return and chose it. VC has my money and the bag, and seems no one bothers to read the emails, neither to follow their own rules. I am lost for words on how bad this platform is.\n\nUpdate 2:\nVC apologised for re-listing the bag and sent it back to me. While I appreaciate the apology I will never buy a designer bag from them and would rather pay more with local consignor. I still think their team who reviews the bags is shockingly careless as I ended up with a bag with cracks in canvas which I would never buy if I was aware of this defect ( and anyone would know that Louis Vuitton would not repair canvas but they can replace leather parts). If the seller is not honest there is high risk the VC will not do much about it and I don\u2019t think the platform is worth my money or nerves. \n\nUpdate 3: \nIn reply to VC comment below, please do read with understanding . Your team of \u201cexperts \u201c twice denied they could see a damage to the canvas of the bag while the VC grading system states there should be no tear to the item if item is listed under good condition, neither the photos uploaded by the seller showed the damage to the canvas. The team of experts does not follow the VC grading system neither they check the bags properly as the damage can be seen with naked eye. So no, the team did not rectify the mistake at all, because if you think the solution is to give a customer a choice of 1. either taking back a faulty product which team of experts failed to spot the damage or 2.tell the customer you will relist the bag for them but you will take 25% commission on it : it is not a solution\u2019 at all . It is simply punishing a customer for the mistake done by the team of experts.","title":"Shocking customer service and poor quality check","stars":1,"location":"IE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vestiairecollective.com?page=39&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-24","author":"Dominika Wojew\u00f3dzka","text":"Please be warned.
