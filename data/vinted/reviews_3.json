The package was declared lost by the transporter. I was refunded (by the transporter) only 1\/7 of the real cost of the item sold as this was the declared value.

A month later its shows as stuck in transit \/ on the way and so on. All of this time I have had conversations and updates from the seller without any issues.\n\nThen randomly Vinted updates the item as delivered and released money to the seller. The tracking still showed the item as in transit. I was not notified its delivered - as far as I knew, I still had to wait for the item to be delivered to the shop for collection. I kept waiting. When I contacted the seller, as expected, no response even after a week although till she received the money I exchanged updates everyday.\n\nI then contacted Vinted. Vinted realised they had messed up but would not back down. They claimed item was delivered on the 13th although could not provide any evidence or proof. I sent screenshots on tracking which till 18th shows as in transit. They didn't say anything to address this. From what I see online now, this appears to be a common scam from Vinted. They mess up and then ask buyer to deal directly with the seller although they very well know seller won't bother to respond. I am not giving up, if only for the principle of it. I am happy to go through all legal routes so Vinted can once and for all stop this organised scam. I have all the proof and evidence I need for a legal case so happy to take this forward.\n\nMy tips for others - I have learnt my lesson, will not be buying from Vinted anymore.","title":"Organised scam run by Vinted","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-11","author":"Jonathan Hawes","text":"I bought a shirt on Vinted thinking it was a mens medium.

And tell others to do so too!\n\nAbsolutely terrible, I wish I could leave minus stars.\n\nI will never sell or buy from Vinted again, and I will continually dissuade the use of this app to everyone I know. This app facilitates scam buyers. As a seller you are not protected here, I recommend eBay, Amazon or Depop, NOT Vinted. \n\nI sold a bundle of 2 books, upon their arrival to the buyer she claims I only sent her one book. I know this is not true. I am meticulous with my checks and I no longer have the \u201cmissing\u201d book in my possession. I asked for proof that she only received one, she sends me a picture of the package which has clearly been opened, had a book removed, and then resealed with tape to look like there\u2019s one missing. In the photo the package is covered in a tonne of tape and it has clear rough edges that have been hacked at with scissors, I know I didn\u2019t send it in this condition because I use bags with sticky tabs! I don\u2019t use tape to seal the bag, only to attach the label. It is painfully clear that the package has been tampered with by the buyer. The buyer of course is unresponsive to my messages, and will not reach an agreement with me (because she wants to scam me). I then have to involve Vinted support and unsurprisingly, they rule in the buyers favour, now she has 2 of my books and her money back as well! Vinted told me that because I didn\u2019t use a cardboard box to send 2 small paper back books, they\u2019re not liable! Their guidance does not state the use of cardboard boxes is mandatory, only ideal. Also, would this have ended differently if I used a cardboard box? Probably not! I\u2019d still be out of pocket. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely disgusting that this has been allowed. I accept that she has scammed me out of one book, but on top of this, the buyer did still send photographic evidence of having one of the books in her possession. So, I point this out to Vinted and they tell me once again that because I didn\u2019t use a cardboard box they won\u2019t do anything, and they also closed the case not allowing me to reply! What?! Where is the money for this book the buyer has shown she\u2019s received? Vinted has facilitated a scammer to steal from me. In fact, handy tip incoming: I\u2019ve learned that if you want something for free off of Vinted, just pretend it didn\u2019t come! Tamper with the packaging and it\u2019s all yours, and so is your money! \n\nThank goodness these books weren\u2019t worth too much. I\u2019m sure this happens constantly to other sellers with much more expensive items, and I feel awful for those sellers who have faced what I did and the horrendously insulting Vinted support. \n\nSo, thanks Vinted, I am now two books down and I have nothing to show for it!\n\nIf you want to lose your items and your money, Vinted is the place for you!","title":"Avoid Vinted like the plague.","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-23","author":"Charles-Louis Orsini Photograp","text":"L\u2019application refuse ma piece d\u2019identit\u00e9 et bloqu\u00e9 mes avoirs.
