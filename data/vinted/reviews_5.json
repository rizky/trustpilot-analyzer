I have bought a lot on vinted without problems but last week I have bought two items listed as age 14 - two different sellers- when I received them they were only aged 12 - I was refunded but I have to return both tops to the sellers- by tracked post - I will end up about 12 pounds out of pocket for two items I didn't want. There is no customer services - just seems a never ending round of automated messages. I will probably not bother buying again - will go back to ebay - least I felt I had some backup as a buyer.","title":"No option to leave zero stars","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-07","author":"Alexa Traylor","text":"Too much faffing around getting the payment received to you.

I didn\u2019t have proof of purchase as they were purchased by an ex partner and I didn\u2019t have extra photos (because why would I?!) so they ruled the trainers not authentic, they refunded the buyer which I found extremely frustrating but I had the intention of getting the trainers officially authenticated and I would resell them. However, Vinted  advised the buyer they didn\u2019t need to return the trainers! Which is absolutely appalling, the authenticity checks were so meagre, based purely on the buyers feedback! I have tried and tried to raise this with their customer care and legal team and have offered to pay for them to have the trainers returned and for them to perform a proper authenticity inspection and have been completely ignored. The trainers was originally \u00a3565 and the buyer got to keep these for free simply by saying they weren\u2019t authentic.","title":"High risk for selling designer goods","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-21","author":"Amanda Avery","text":"Absolute scammers.
