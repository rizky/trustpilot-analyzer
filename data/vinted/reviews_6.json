They said they were investigating it and requesting more evidence from the seller. I got a message that the bag was authentic and the seller was paid instantly. So i listed the bag to resell, within 10 mins vinted deleted it, telling me it was fake, they threatened to close my account if i tried to list it again.\nI sold a bundle of 3 items two were \u00a330+ and one just \u00a32.50 The buyer reported a dot on the lower priced item and requested to return for a refund. I clicked to accept, instantly vinted refunded the full amount and manually cancelled the transaction. No returns information. NOTHING\nThey told me they do not provide partial refunds, and told me i had cancelled the transaction myself and paid her back in full. I did no such thing, the message said the transaction had been manually cancelled by VINTED. They said i would have to deal with the customer outside of vinted, maybe she would agree to refund me via bank transfer. YEAH RIGHT\nThis is why 80% of the bags listed are fakes, and why it is a breeding ground for scammers.\nVinted make millions through the payment protection they charge on every transaction, the only time they ever refund is when it can be proved the couriers lost it. Then there is \u00a350 maximum you can claim, and it takes weeks and weeks before they will investigate it.\nOn both occasions i contacted them with my issues. They gave their decision and then blocked me from being able to contact them again about these transactions.\nHow they are allowed to trade is beyond me.\nI wonder why they have never responded to any of the reviews. They do not try and defend themselves because they can`t.\nSecond-hand fashion platform Vinted is already worth 3.5 billion euros. Vinted, an online platform for second-hand clothing, raised 250 million euros to support its further expansion. During the financing round, the Lithuanian company was estimated to be worth 3.5 billion euros.12 May 2021","title":"This platform needs investigating","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=6&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-08-23","author":"Alice  K","text":"Twice now I\u2019ve tried to buy an item on Vinted and there was apparently an \u201cissue on their end\u201d.
