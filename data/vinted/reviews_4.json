Starr","text":"Be careful when doing business via this website.\nThey have a threshold of how much you can sell, and when this limit is reached (and they can't say how much is the limit), they only release the payments (of items you already sold!) to your bank account IF you give them ALL information they demand, such as a copy of your passport\/ID card, etc.\n\nSo if you are not willing to give copies of your documents, do not sell via Vinted.\nAlso, there are fake messages being sent to you requesting you to send documents to them.\n\nThese fake messages look EXACTLY the same as messages from customer support, so be aware, is possible that you will be scammed very easily and without even noticing.\n\nI sold 4 items via Vinted and it went well regarding the buyers and their payment to Vinted. \nIt did not go well with Vinted paying me, since I am not willing to disclose my passport to them. So they have almost 600, Euros that belong to my last sale (a purse) in their possession. I am contacting my lawyer to dispute this and I will no longer use this website.\n\nSo my final tip is: take the time to READ ALL their CONDITIONS before you make the effort\/lose the time to list your items in there - you might sell, ship your merchandise and be left empty handed.","title":"Be careful when doing business via Vinted","stars":1,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=4&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-07","author":"ES Carter","text":"I've been buying\/selling on Vinted for about 6 months. I had over 400 5 star reviews from buyers and sellers.\nI stuck to the rules. I thought it was a good place to sell even though it can take ages to get your money from a buyer and if you receive something tatty\/damaged\/fake it can take Vinted ages to resolve despite them charging buyers a 'protection fee'.\nI always used the money in my Vinted account to buy more things, never once making a withdrawal as it was a way to sell our unwanted things and buy preloved, as Vinted proudly state 'shopping doesn't have to cost the earth'.\nThat was until my account got blocked today for no valid reason. The automated response for the blocking did not apply to anything I had sold or done on the site and they refused my right to appeal.\nThey've also STOLEN all the monies I had in my Vinted account and I cannot access any of the transactions where I am waiting for things to arrive that I have bought, so I will have had around \u00a3250+ stolen from me in total by Vinted. THIS IS THEFT plain and simple. I will be contacting Citizen's Advice regarding this in the UK. I cannot see, after having read so many awful experiences and stolen monies via Vinted, how they can continue to get away with this.","title":"BEWARE. I wish I'd checked reviews before using.
