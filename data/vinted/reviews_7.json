I have sold a number of items without a problem. Posting labels are sent via the Vinted system pre paid by the buyer. I have had the misfortune to have lost an item in transit. The label was attached and the item sent in good faith but did not arrive. I have been told there is no record of it being sent. I was given a receipt at the shop I dropped it off at-not worth the paper. It doesn't show up on Hermes system so not sent and cannot be investigated further. As a seller  you have no control over the postage and have to send your items in good faith. I have lost the dress and been made to feel like a criminal.

Vinted's customer support is probably one of the most atrocious I've experience. You'll get generic replies to issues and no real help. I invited a friend which is supposed to get you a \u00a35 voucher and then a \u00a310 voucher when they sell something. The forth voucher I was accused of having 2 accounts and took 2 weeks of both of us talking with them to finally prove we are separate people. Then the second voucher I was told I haven't actually referred anyone because apparently they keep no notes. It's still unsolved. I asked to speak to a supervisor as I wanted to make a complaint and I was told to \"Report it to my local authority\" I thought it must have been a joke.

However, there are several things they never improved and that for me result in the 2 stars review. It has been years I use vinted but there is never a obvious way to contact vinted if encounter any problem \n( I have been using vinted for a long time so for me is not that difficult but this complaints have been filed by so many other people and they just never been heard by Vinted ). \n\nHowever, the main reason for giving them 2 stars is the poor quality service. I personally rarely encounter bad experience on vinted but I couple unpleasant experiences is quite enough. And whenever that happened, vinted never resolve anything, and sometimes for both seller and buyer. They often just ask buyer and seller to \"talk\" to resolve the issue instead trying to help the situation. (this have happened to a lot of people according to the forum I read) For me that is quite irresponsible on the part of vinted, which result in a 2 stars review.","title":"It's okay, but need changes.","stars":2,"location":"FR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-06-28","author":"Debora Orlandi","text":"Awful experience, both with seller and with Vinted. The pictures posted by the seller depicted a Funko Pop with mint box and figure. When the Pop arrived to me, I noticed many creases on the box and the transparent stand base  was missed. I sent some pictures to the seller in order to show him the creases and the lack of the stand base. The seller said that he didn't know about the missing stand base because he never opened the box (!?) and he offered me a 5\u20ac refund to buy another stand base (!?!?). Moreover, he said that I was dishonest because when he sent the Pop to me there were no injuries on the box. Just insane. I wrote to Vinted to explain the issue and Vinted ruled in favor of the seller because according to Vinted the seller's description was fair. That's the seller's description:\n\n\"Funko pop Pulp Fiction - Mia Wallace (rare) funko pop, mia Wallace du film pulp fiction de Quentin Tarantino \/ ORIGINAL NOT A COPY\"\n\nI think it's not fair to omit that a piece of the figure is missed, it's not fair to post pictures that show an apparently perfect box and ask the price for a mint rare Funko Pop (144\u20ac). I'm a newcomer on Vinted, the seller is a long-time user with more than 400 sales on Vinted. I think that's the reason why Vinted ruled in favor of the seller.
