The post office marked the postcode slightly wrong on the proof of postage. The package was slightly delayed, as most Royal Mail packages are at the moment due to Covid. The buyer worried that it hadn't arrived and raised it with Vinted on the 5th day. Vinted automatically refunded the buyer, telling me it was because the post code was wrong. Vinted do not seem to understand that even if the postcode is wrong Royal Mail will deliver it to the correct address as the correct address was marked up on the package. \n\nI contacted the buyer to ask her to send it back when she got it. She was super honest and told me she had just got the package and everything was correct, including the postcode, She has now been told by Vinted that she will need my bank details to send me the money once she gets a refund as she wants to keep the item. \n\nIf Vinted would have allowed a few days grace and had a better understanding of the UK postage system this whole issue would not have happened.

Le mardi 2 septembre, l'acheteur a confirm\u00e9 la r\u00e9ception et la satisfaction. J'ai demand\u00e9 que l'argent soit transf\u00e9r\u00e9 de mon porte-monnaie \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 mon compte bancaire, mais malgr\u00e9 le courriel de confirmation, le transfert \u00e9tait en attente. Le lendemain, j'ai contact\u00e9 le support pour demander des explications et ils m'ont dit que c'\u00e9tait normal, que parfois il faut 48h et donc d\u2019attendre. Apr\u00e8s 48h, le transfert est toujours en attente et le support a eu le courage de me dire qu'ils doivent enqu\u00eater pour comprendre le probl\u00e8me et que je devrai attendre des semaines. Nous avons vendu ces chaussures tr\u00e8s ch\u00e8res parce que notre b\u00e9b\u00e9 a besoin d'une intervention urgente. D\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e, j'ai essay\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 Mangopay et une dame tr\u00e8s gentille m'a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne voyait aucun probl\u00e8me avec mon paiement et qu'elle contacterait Vinted imm\u00e9diatement pour faire d\u00e9bloquer le transfert. Malgr\u00e9 tout cela, Vinted n'a pas encore d\u00e9bloqu\u00e9 mon paiement de 3000\u20ac. Mon avocat m'a dit qu'il s'agissait d'un d\u00e9tournement de fonds et que Vinted serait l\u00e9galement responsable si quelque chose arrivait \u00e0 mon enfant, mais il est pire et je me sens impuissante et d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e parce que Vinted ne me donne pas l'argent pour payer l'intervention. J'ai fait part de la gravit\u00e9 de la situation \u00e0 Vinted mais, de toute \u00e9vidence, ils ont plus int\u00e9ress\u00e9 par les int\u00e9r\u00eats bancaires sur mon argent et de celui d'autres utilisateurs malheureux (je suis s\u00fbre que je ne suis pas le seule dans cette situation) que par la sant\u00e9 de mon enfant.\n\nI sold a pair of my husband's shoes. On Tuesday, September 2nd, the buyer confirmed receipt and satisfaction. I requested that the money be transferred from my e-wallet to my bank account, but despite the confirmation email, the transfer was pending. The next day, I contacted the support team to ask for explanations and they told me that this was normal, that sometimes it takes 48 hours and therefore to wait. After 48 hours, the transfer is still pending and the support had the courage to tell me that they have to investigate to understand the problem and that I will have to wait weeks. We sold these very expensive shoes because our baby needs urgent surgery . Desperate, I tried to phone Mangopay and a very nice lady told me that she saw no problem with my payment and that she would contact Vinted immediately to get the transfer unblocked. Despite all this, Vinted has not yet released my payment of 3000\u20ac. My lawyer told me that this was a misappropriation of funds and that Vinted would be legally responsible if anything happened to my child, but he\u2019is worse and I feel helpless and desperate because Vinted is not giving me the money to pay for the surgery.I have told Vinted about the seriousness of the situation but obviously they are more interested in the bank interest on my money and that of other unlucky  users (I am sure I am not alone in this situation) than in my child's health.","title":"ARNAQUE SCAM","stars":1,"location":"FR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=11&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-09-30","author":"Suzie Russell","text":"BUYERS BEWARE!
