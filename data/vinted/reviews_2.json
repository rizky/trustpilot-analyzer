Listed a lot of old and new things just make a little bit of money back from things I had that weren\u2019t going to get used. Main thing I enjoyed about Vinted was that buyers are responsible for selecting and paying for their own shipping, all I had to do was print and post which took a lot of the hassle out of selling things and made more worthwhile. \n\nLast week a seller had messaged me to say an item she bought hadn\u2019t arrived. As the 2 days were almost up for me to get the money transferred, I messaged customer service and asked them to hold the payment until I was able to resolve the issue for the buyer. I then messaged the buyer to inform them that I had requested for payment to be held. Next morning I wake up to a message from Vinted stating that it had been brought to their attention that I was using my profile for \u2018commercial activity\u2019 and to \u2018generate a steady income\u2019 and that my account\/IP address had been permanently blocked. I had been selling on Vinted for 6 months and made \u00a3100 max. Definitely not a steady income nor indicating any commercial activity or \u2018monetary gain\u2019 - which is another no-no on Vinted apparently. \n\nTheir guidelines states that users will be given a warning and they will seek to provide support before blocking users. This was not the experience that I had, my account was fully blocked and no warning given and no way to dispute their claims as apparently once you\u2019ve been blocked, you cannot be unblocked. \n\nOverall, a really disappointing experience from such a huge platform who are pushing their advertising to get people to join but then placing a permanent ban so easily. Especially when there are many, many profiles on there which are actively and obviously using the site for commercial gain and face no consequences.","title":"Blocked without warning, unable to dispute","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=2&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-22","author":"Jennifer Blake","text":"Absolutely pants!
