I had a problem with a transaction once and I contacted customer service but they replied 1+ week later and I had to find a way to work it out myself besides the fact that they keep a percentage of the transaction for their services. Still, I will keep on using it because I can find many items in very good prices, I wouldn't recommend it for expensive items, but as long as buy only cheap stuff,  in case something goes wrong you won't lose much.","title":"Bad customer service, but good idea","stars":3,"location":"FR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=14&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2017-09-23","author":"Amanda Watt","text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE COMPANY.

I made 2 purchases on Vinted and had problems with modifying the shipping address. The sellers I dealt with were great but unfortunately we had to rely on Vinted who never read the messages properly and never helped. On one hand, I contacted them about editing the address and after weeks of back & forth, they asked me to contact the seller despite my telling them that we've been in contact from the start - same from the seller side. It's now been over 1 mo without any progress from Vinted and so I raised a dispute with Visa. Vinted messaged to say disputes outside of Vinted aren't allowed and I needed to cancel this within 48 hours or be blocked. I cancelled this with visa within 24 hours and was still blocked. The message says that I did not reply (and yet the reply button on that chat was disabled and the email address is 'no reply').

But they have blocked my account so I can't reply to the buyer or themselves! My bag is a genuine Gucci bag from 2003, the buyer received & said it was a fake adding photos to prove it, the photos were clearly not of my actual bag, but another bag (mine has red & green Gucci straps on the photographed bag was all black with brown edges!). I informed vinted of this & in their responses they never addressed this, despite photos of my bag still being available on their website. On checking the buyers reviews she has cancelled 21 previous sales! I know now she has stolen my bag by scamming me (& 21 others), she said she would post it back & hasn't, I'm going to see if trading standards can help me. DO NOT USE VINTED, you will have a few lovely buyers, but you will be scammed on expensive items & vinted allow it, their response positively encourages the buyer to repeatedly steal items with no recourse for the seller.
