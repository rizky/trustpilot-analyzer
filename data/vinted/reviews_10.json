They ask me to commit a crime and send a fake item back to the seller. They do not even give her a warning or anything. So I need to commit a crime and send it back, pay 10 EUR for the delivery, and then the buyer is OK to keep her account and continue selling fake items. They are such a joke. They have been so unprofessional and even rude in their responses. My recommendations are to NOT by brands from this site because Vinted is just full of lies and incompetent people.

But when she got home she put in an issue with vinted saying that her parcel was open and that there was nothing in there. But when I dropped off the parcel I made sure that it was sealed and I triple checked and so did the shop owner. I was so disappointed, as I  had previously been using Depop but started selling on Vinted because there was no commission. But unlike depop they don't have ANY seller protection. So the buyer got a FULL refund and got to keep the item that I sent but they pretended that they never got. So I got scammed off of my money and I will never use Vinted again.
