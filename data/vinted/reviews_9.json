The next morning I log into my account to find it is permanently blocked, with no warning, never to be unblocked and preventing me from making another account. They said I was on the app for commercial purposes (untrue) looking to make a steady income (untrue). I explained my situation to customer services, that I had probably had an honest misunderstanding about what I could sell, and that I would remove the bracelets. I was only on there, after all, to sell a few old clothes and accessories for under \u00a310 each. I then get another notice saying I was trying to sell counterfeit goods (???). Customer service tells me they won't unblock my account, I will never be able to rejoin the app using another account, and thank me for my time with them, (all of about 15 hours). After politely and honestly explaining my situation, the treatment I received was disgraceful. After giving the app a chance, I will absolutely be sticking to Depop and eBay, and will be telling everyone I know about the farce that is Vinted.
