Real name Albert Jimenez, living in La Penne-sur-Huveaune, boulevard Voltaire 164. It started when I saw pink Versace bikini in his dressing for a good price, as this person has mostly good feedbacks I bought it. When I received a parcel, I confirmed the sale, I did not check the bikini closer, because this seller was with good feedbacks, of course. When I arrived home and tried this bikini, it was too small for me, it already appeared strange for me, because I am always size S with Versace. So, I was thinking, no problem, I will resell it, I put it for resale and immediately I got a notification that it is fake, so, I was really surprised, I started to inspect it closer, I found the real ones in google from official shops to compare the photos and, of course, the I realized that it is fake, poor sewing, no CLG codes. So, I contacted alberto1719 and asked why did he sell me fake, that it is not permitted to sale fakes, I sent him all photos to compare the bikini I bought from him with the screenshots from real ones. And then alberto1719 started lying. he told that he bought this bikini in Italy 2 years ago as a real one, so, 2 years ago this model even did not exist at all, he was lying 100%. Then he told that he will send me a bill, so I was skeptical, I told him that anybody can make a fake bill with a PDF corrector, but ok, please, send me. He never sent me a bill, he blocked me. So, I added a bad feedback. After adding a bad feedback alberto1719 unblocked me and said that he can \"buy back\" this bikini from me if I delete a feedback, so we agreed and I deleted feedback, added this bikini in my dressing without any brand, simply as pink bikini, he bought it. I packed a bikini, made photos of parcel and sent it to him. And what happened? Bikini arrived in the pick-up point alberto1719 chose. I wrote a message to him and told that bikini has arrived, no reaction, at the same time he was online every day. So one week passed and when alberto1719 got an automatic positive feedback (as I had deleted my bad feedback) from vinted, he immediately started lying again, he opened a case that he did not receive a parcel (vinted explained him that parcel is waiting at the pick up point for him). Do you think he went to pick up it? No. He just wrote me some stories in his style, first that he did not know where the parcel is, after that he will pick up immediately and after some hours that he simply could not go to the pick up point. At the same time I see new feedbacks in his profile, he is definitely going to the pick up points to pick up or to send other parcels, but he is refusing to pick up a parcel with bikini. A different version each time. Now I see, the plan of this person was just to tell me that will buy back the fake bikini to avoid a bad feedback and never pick up it. And now this scammer blocked me again. I already reported him to the police. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON, SELLING 100% FAKES AND SCAMMING PEOPLE.","title":"Alberto1719 (Albert Jimenez) selling fakes, scammer.","stars":1,"location":"CH","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-21","author":"Marlene Brown","text":"Parcel canceled by seller money took then put back in in then they took from bank account again i contact bank told to contact vinted  give me run around basically took 12 pound of my money","title":"Taking money from bank","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-04-22","author":"Ruxandra Ioana","text":"Horrible customer service. \nThis is the second time around I have this problem ( I know, I should know better than to buy from this s***y platform). \nAgain, I have stumbled upon a fake product ( \u2018Chanel\u2019 sunglasses this time).

I love the fact that it helps you with shipping so that you don't have to do it yourself. Personally it saves me a lot of trouble. I also think that the way the site works overall is pretty good.\n\nOne big issue I have though is that Vinted feels the needs to automatically cancel an order if there aren't any shipment updates within 4 days. This creates a huge issue. \n\nDon't get me wrong, most shipping carrier companies have tickets that only last about 5 days (after which you can not use those anymore for shipping), I don't have an issue with that. Vinted has a holiday mode in case you don't want anyone to buy stuff while you are unable to ship anything for a few days.\n\nThe issue comes when carriers like MondialRelay or DPD fail to update their tracking. (Usually for about 2 days). Vinted does absolutely nothing to help the seller or the customer out in this case. If you shipped an item worth 50 bucks 3 days after you sold the item, and the tracking doesn't update for another 2 days, the order is just cancelled. Nothing you can do about it. Obviously the sollution is to just ship the item earlier, but it honestly is a horrible policy and I wish they would change it. It'd safe a lot of stress.\n\nThere is also the fact that Vinted charges you before an order is confirmed, and if the order is cancelled it takes a while before you can get your money back. Sometimes people even get charged multiple times. And customer service is basically none existent. If your question isn't among their basic issues, you can't contact them properly.\n\nThese aren't huge problems, but feel like things that could be avoided with a little more care and thought.","title":"It's not bad, but not perfect either.","stars":3,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-05-06","author":"Mrs allyson raison","text":"Vinted are they taking money transactions not authorised ringing fraud squad","title":"Vinted are they taking money\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-05-07","author":"Donna Mitchell","text":"Absolutely shocking customer service, I am a buyer who like many others have had duplicate payments .
