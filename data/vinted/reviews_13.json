The support is a total joke. Don't buy on this website unless you want to throw your money by the window.\n\nI have purchased an Air Jordan pair of shoes and I never received the product. The Post Office said it was delivered but I've never seen the colour of the package nor the pair of shoes, which I paid \u20ac150 for. \n\nI warned Vinted support about that and they kept sending me the same message over and over again (\"We're sorry to hear that you didn't receive the product, please contact the post office\"). I asked the Post Office to make an investigation to know where the package was. I sent Vinted support a proof that I opened an investigation case. The investigation isn't finished yet, but they closed the litigation on Vinted between the seller and me, even if the Post Office didn't give me an answer about the result of the investigation. \n\nSo the seller received his money and I paid for nothing. I asked them but they said that \"the Post Office said it was delivered so it's delivered\". \n\nLuckily I paid with PayPal, so I opened a litigation case with PayPal. I warned the Vinted support about that and they said that \"according to their Terms and Conditions\", my account may be blocked. BECAUSE I OPENED A LITIGATION CASE ON PAYPAL. \n\nAnyway. I'm asking for my money back and they don't have proof to give to justify the closure of the litigation. \n\nThey threatened me to block my account but they can, actually I don't care at all and I won't buy on this website EVER AGAIN.","title":"Worst experience ever","stars":1,"location":"FR","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=13&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2019-04-27","author":"Lieke","text":"The first 3 sells go very fluently, it seems that Vinted helps you a bit with getting views on the app. Afterwards your items don't get any views anymore even if you pay to boost them.

Extremely bad company. Sellers are not protected against scams at all.\n\nI sold one coat (value RRP 150\u20ac) on Vinted last year, the coat was exactly as described in my listing. The buyer complained to Vinted saying (and lying!) that the size was not correct and not as described. The story behind this is that she clearly lied and said that as an excuse to return the item because she didn't like the coat. \nDespite all the proofs I sent to Vinted, the buyer was authorized by Vinted to send me the coat back. The buyer had her refund, I lost my money and she apparently sent the coat back with Mondial Relay: the 150\u20ac coat never arrived to me and has been lost (or stolen?). I lost my money, my coat has been lost and I have not received any compensation or any money back from Vinted. The buyer lied, Vinted trusted her without any proofs. \n\nVinted doesn't protect the sellers agains scams at all, I don't recommend anyone to use it.  \n\nIt is impossible to have a discussion with a person working for Vinted as you only receive meaningless automatic\/robotic replies to your complaints.
