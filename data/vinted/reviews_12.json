Items were stolen from a parcel I sent a buyer, contacted Vinted. They then proceed to refund the buyer and not me, saying the items were stolen as items not packaged properly. They were packaged the same way as every other item I have sent and received, I was then sent packaging guidelines for Royal Mail to put me in my place. Which was no good as I sent with Hermes and broke no guidelines? The package is a large plastic postal package which is waterproof and had seal, which I then taped over to be extra secure! These packages are standard and there is nothing wrong with them, most customers use them  and it says nowhere they are substandard. I have had items stolen because the package was opened by someone, the did not fall out, the package is clearly ripped open and taped down again, but I am being blamed and not compensated? This company is a joke and their customer service appalling!

I have a 100% positive feedback until today. I accidentally cancelled an order after the seller didn't post out after 4 days. I sent the seller a reminder but there was no response, so stupidly I thought it was a good idea to cancel the order, which most people would. Vinted offered me a refund, then gave me negative feedback. I have sent them numerous messages asking them to remove the feedback to no avail. I had one customer service adviser being sarcastic and recommending I go elsewhere. I couldn\u2019t believe it \ud83d\ude33 Vinted has no loyalty or respect for excellent buyers and sellers. I have spent literally hundreds of pounds with them this week and am absolutely gobsmacked that they can treat good people like this.

The first thing you need to know is that they may or may not be in cahoots with the courier MONDIAL RELAY. It's very inexpensive but something is wrong here. Parcels going missing at an astronomically high rate (read around on here, facebook, and the vinted forums -- a search for 'colis perdu Mondial relay' will turn up hundreds of threads. And just look at their FAQ \"what to do if your parcel is lost is question #1 -- that speaks volumes). This is speculative, but Mondial relay may be stealing parcels systematically from vinted given that its always the high value parcels that go missing and never the small dollar or less interesting stuff. Just whatever you do DON'T USE Mondial relay for a high dollar or unique item bought on vinted. Use COLISSIMO which, despite the goofy name, is actually the OFFICIAL French post parcel division. In fact, use DHL or UPS because the French post is kind of screwed up too from what I hear, but nowhere near Mondial relay levels (10k bad reviews for Mondial relay on trustpilot, 1.6k for colissimo. Just go with the numbers here, not the rating, everybody is here to leave a bad review).\n\nThat being said, Vinted is the best app of its kind other than maybe eBay in terms of the variety, quality and low price of the items on it. A huge amount of dazzling designer steals straight from France, which is basically the secondhand designer capitol of the world -- and they don't use ebay, so its all here -- can be found here and I highly recommend that aspect of it. Just be extremely careful with shipment because MONDIAL RELAY is NOT TRUSTWORTHY WHATSOEVER. They lost a 300 euro one of a kind Balmain prototype meanwhile they delivered a pair of 20euro boots no problem and all the seller's other small dollar H&M jeans.","title":"Wonderful marketplace but WATCH OUT for Mondial relay","stars":2,"location":"ES","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/vinted.fr?page=12&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2020-06-01","author":"MC","text":"I used to like Vinted a lot but lately they keep deleting my listings claiming I made a copyright violation by stealing the pictures but in reality I TOOK ALL OF THEM!!!
