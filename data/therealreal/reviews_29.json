Also read they run 1\/2-1 size small so I ordered a size 8 (i wear size 7 shoes), and not onky were they small but i was only allowed to return 1 thought it both did  not specify it couldn\u2019t be returned -!!\n\n Instead it offered consignment for the Jimmy Choo wedges thst were sais to be in excellent condition but it definitely wasnt and probably why they didnt want it back. Also, i had to oay to ship it back and be charged an additional $12 for thr label i paid for\u2026such a scam. It definitely wasNOT in exellent condition and fit was awful and they were Pradas!.  Also it says I have 21 days deom date od purchase to refurnn\/consign, etc but it took 14 days to get my items! I had to rush yo thr overpriced UPS store so i wouldnt be late. However, what about changing the return policy to 21 days from date item is delicious bs bought - read fine print and evem then, a lot of things are missing since mosf song read it. Scam scam scam. Id never recommend this site to anyone who doesnt want to be ripped off. \n\n  consignment I\u2019m only given 50% of listed price which is MUCH lower than I paid- such a scam. Also, i got 2 calls and 3 emails regal consignment within 24 hours or less in rececing my items. I asked them to take me off their list but then they chose go ignore itnor didnt read my email and texted me instead and ignored anything that asked them to stop messaging me. \n\nI\u2019ll NEVER buy from here again.","title":"Couldnt return 1 of 2 shoes, & pay to ship items back","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=29&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-16","author":"Debi F.","text":"As a Seller, I was contacted by a rep that offered to pick up my items the next day instead of having me ship the items.
