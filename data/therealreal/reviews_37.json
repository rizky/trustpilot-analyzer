I need the bags to store the shoes in when not in use and as well as for when I\u2019m traveling. I understand if it\u2019s lost and could not be located but I would appreciate someone getting back to me at least and tell me so rather than ignoring my emails. This may not be a big deal for TRR, but it is for me. If you can\u2019t stand behind the description of your items at least let your buyers know their inquiries are heard.
