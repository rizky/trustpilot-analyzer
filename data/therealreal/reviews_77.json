You\u2019d have nothing if you didn\u2019t have people selling, yet all of your policies favor the buyer.   You allow them to use and wear items and then return them with your overly liberal return policy.  You should take the promotional discounts from YOUR profit.  We didn\u2019t offer the discount YOU did.  Finally, you play a terrible game when it comes to paying people.  Holding on to funds for weeks or months because of your ridiculous pay out schedule.  As for the purchase I just made, I\u2019d give it a two.  It was a piece of fine jewelry wrapped in tissue paper and tape.","title":"TRR is the worst","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=77&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-03","author":"customer","text":"I CAN ONLY GIVE ONE STAR BECAUSE WHILE THIS LAST ORDER WAS CORRECT, EVERY OTHER ORDER HAS BEEN THE WRONG ITEM AND A NIGHTMARE TO BE CORRECTED.","title":"I CAN ONLY GIVE ONE STAR BECAUSE WHILE\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=77&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-03","author":"Nate","text":"I attempted to edit an order but the design of the text based help failed miserably. I ordered 2 jewelry items late one evening and then found early the next morning that many of my saved items had been reduced in price so I wanted to order 5 additional items to combine with my pending order.  I followed the text help prompts and had two relevant options D) cancel order and E) other.  I selected other which sent me into a black hole canned response mechanism stating that someone would her back to me soon. As the minutes passed and knowing the cancellation window was soon ending, I tried to re-enter the help queue to access the cancel prompt, after which expecting to go about rebuilding my shopping bag hoping to see my canceled items placed back into inventory.  This failed design of a help system would not let me renter the help process on this order, presumably programmed to think that my request had already been satisfied. About 45 min later customer service contacted me about the help request and stated that they could not help me with combining my orders or cancelling the first one since it was already sent to UPS. After many pauses and apparent internal conversations, the rep said all he can do is one time credit 12.95 shipping on the new additional $750 order after I processed it.  That was 1 week ago and I see no credits available in my TRR account.  This seems like such an easy customer service request. TRR needs to take ownership of the poor design and unacceptable service in rectifying it. The system should simply let one return to the help queue to cancel the order or at the very least have indicated that selecting \u2018E) other\u2019 would prevent you from ever returning to the queue to cancel the order.  I expect at least $40 credit applied for the duplicate $12.95 shipping and the $28.50 lost sale price on one of the items in the first order as this is how much I\u2019d have saved by simply clicking cancel first order and rebuilding the cart.","title":"Real Help customer service needs real help","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=77&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-03","author":"RD","text":"Sizing of items have been incorrect.
