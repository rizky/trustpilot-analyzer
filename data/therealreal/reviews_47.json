The response time was excellent. That's where the positive ended for me. \n\nI ordered a beautiful Charvet white silk pocket square that was described as being in \"pristine condition\", their highest ranking. I received it and was quite surprised to notice there was an obvious glue stain in one corner from a sticker (which was only marginally improved by hand-washing and by using rubbing alcohol), a small 2mm hole in the fabric, 2 loose loops in the thread on the rolled edges, as well as 3 loose filaments of silk pulled from the fabric. None of these defects were mentioned in the description.\n\nWhen I reached out to the company to sort out this situation, I was offered to return the item, but they would not reimburse at all the original shipping fees (they charged me >40$ here in Canada), and the return fees would only be offered as store credits. I would end up loosing a lot of money from the shipping fees and only get the back returned article's value. It would be acceptable if I had decided I no longer wanted the item, but given that this was the seller mistake in the first place, this was an unacceptable resolution. \n\nIf I refused to return the item (and waste the shipping fees money), all they were willing to offer was 25$ of store credits. If they had offered 25$ money-back, that would have been slightly more acceptable, but offering store credits when it's their own mistake is crass at best. Not the kind of business-model you would expect from an average retailler, let alone a premium one.","title":"Bad return policy even when they are at fault.","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=47&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"customer","text":"The website asked me if I wanted my prices in Canadian dollars, which I accepted.

I thought when they said in the website that items have minor wear, they meant some discoloration, fading, and other kinds. I didn't know it also meant that there are holes in the garments. I couldn't use 3 out of the 4 I purchased because the holes were in unsightly places and couldn't be remedied by just trimming the hem. I guess I'll be careful next time I buy from them.","title":"I bought some pants from them","stars":2,"location":"PH","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=47&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"customer","text":"My items description stated ... excellent.
