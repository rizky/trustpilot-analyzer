The order shipped in multiple packages yet only one tracking number was provided in the order details. One item I purchased could not be found in inventory so I got a note that I would be credited. Items were slow to ship. I had questions. I sent 3 separate outreach emails to customer service (one for each question). Never got a reply on any of them.
