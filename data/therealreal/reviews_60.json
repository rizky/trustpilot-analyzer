HOWEVER, if you purchase a \"Final\" sale and reconsign the item as I did.  The shoe was sold and then returned as mine was Final Sale and as the shoe remains on the website it continues to go down in price.  So in essence, my $95 purchase was posted at $87 the first time it was posted on their website providing me with $24 in monies if sold!  Now it is $70 some which will be $15 or so.  I will never do this again especially since my higher purchase cost of this shoe at $95 was Final Sale.  So in wrapping this up, I was taken almost $100 and have learned to never work with this online consignment again.","title":"I have purchased from this website and\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=60&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-20","author":"Alexandra","text":"Shipping is too expensive","title":"Shipping is too expensive","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=60&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-20","author":"customer","text":"I twice made appointments and no one ever connected with me or contacted me.","title":"I twice made appointments and no one\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=60&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-20","author":"customer","text":"The shirt was stain and the material bleeded with dye","title":"The shirt was stain and the material\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=60&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-20","author":"Andrea","text":"Unfortunately, my purchase didn\u2019t work out.
