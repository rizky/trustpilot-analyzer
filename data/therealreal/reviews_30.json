The item is a glass bird that is valuable and the box arrived torn and open.  Fortunately the glass bird is in one piece as there was good bubble wrap around it.  In the past the glass items were shipped in larger boxes with significantly more wrapping and tape.  Had the box been just a bit more torn I'm sure the glass bird would have fallen out in the usps systerm.  The usps handles millions of packages a day I imagine and if you are going to ship via the usps then please pack the items more securely.  It is in your best interest as well as the customer's.  Thank you very much for an otherwise fine transaction.","title":"Poor packaging","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=30&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-16","author":"Jennifer Todd","text":"Be careful what you purchase just make sure you read throughly on the description some of the items have been used quite well but they must state it on the description I purchased a small purse and it was used a little bit more than I would like...and nonrefundable:(","title":"Be careful what you purchase just make\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=30&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-16","author":"Sandra Hankerson","text":"The sizes are incorrect every time I order","title":"The sizes are incorrect every time I\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=30&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-16","author":"Jacqueline Wernick","text":"The LV belt I purchased did not have a keeper and it was not mentioned in the website.

I also like that in-store returns are an option.\n\nWith this order and a couple of others the item comes poorly packaged. The earrings from my latest order did no hav the tag attached. I need to return them because, although beautiful and a great price, they don't look good on me. You require tags be attached for a return. I called the CS phone number and was on hold for awhile and then offered a call back when it became my turn. That was was about 8 hours ago. No call back. So because the condition of the items on arrival and the lack of customer service, I have to give a poor rating for this order. I still need confirmation that I can return the earrings (no tag attached as received) to the PA store on 4\/22.","title":"Hello","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=30&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-16","author":"Elizabeth","text":"I Love The RealReal but the customer service replies are extremely slow to non-existent.","title":"I Love The RealReal but the customer\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=30&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
