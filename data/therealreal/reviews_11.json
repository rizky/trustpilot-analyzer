Whenever I have a problem such as items being returned to me as a consigner, it takes 2 weeks to get the item sent back. By that time, it has usually sold. Also, I have on many occasions, sent in item that are sent back to me because :Item not on current consignment list even though I have the identical item currently listed, AND the site allowed me to list the item in order to ship it. Most of my concerns get the general reply of \"I will need to send it up the chain of command\" and it take forever to resolve the problem. I have also requested items be retuned to me when marked down 70% or more. The original item was sent in new with tags but returned to me with tags removed and a realreal tag stating this item cannot be returned if this tag is removed, so I think the item sold, was returned by the buyer after cutting off the tags and wearing it, then returned to me. I have questioned this several time and submitted original tags pictures, but get no response.","title":"Terrible Customer Service","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=11&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-01","author":"Kevin","text":"No where did the listing specify that this was an extremely narrow British \u201cC\u201d width shoe.
