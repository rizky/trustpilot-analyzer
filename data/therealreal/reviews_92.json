I just did, and boy, do I regret it! They offered me a $50 \"bribe\" to consign with them, and now that they put my clothes up, I can see why the bribe was needed. One of the dresses, for example, is a Carolina Herrera brand new dress with tags that I purchased at a Carolina Herrera store and never wore. Not only was it never worn, it hadn't even been tried on since I owned it! (My daughter felt it wasn't her look.) The dress, which originally retailed for $700, went directly from the Carolina Herrera shopping bag to the Real Real. It sold the first day they put it up. Do you know what my earnings are? 16 dollars! Sixteen whole dollars for a 700 dollar dress! They put it up without saying it is brand new with tags. In fact, they wrote, \"minor pull throughout.\" The dress was BRAND NEW. There wasn't a single pull anywhere unless it happened in transit to them.\n And the other clothes I consigned were put up with equally low price tags. When I gave them the clothes, they told me that if they don't want one of them, they'll mail it back to me, so I figured I have nothing to lose. But I see now that instead of them spending money on shipping, they keep the clothes and put them up at ridiculously low prices, so that they sell quickly. What thieves! I could have put my clothes up on Ebay -- yes, a bit more work involved -- and easily netted six times the amount I'll be earning here. I will NEVER consign with them again. Don't fall for their scam.","title":"A scam!
