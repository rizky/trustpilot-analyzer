I have shopped with TRR for quite a while and have had so many issues, it\u2019s unreal. The most recent experience being i was sent a $25 off coupon code. I attempted to use the coupon code and while it applied the discount, noted that the sales tax was being calculated on the prices of the items pre-discount, which is incorrect. I reached out to customer service and didn\u2019t not receive an answer until about 6 hours later. It was about 9:00 pm by then and I was putting my child to bed, wasn\u2019t able to answer the phone. By the time I was able to check my messages, the agent had logged on and ended our chat within 5 mins, didn\u2019t even give me a moment to reply. The issues I have had with the website are countless, and the customer support is borderline useless. Every time I have tried to shop here lately, it\u2019s been so frustrating to the point where I just don\u2019t bother. Great prices and great product, terrible customer service and they make no sense whatsoever. I believe the sales tax issue is borderline illegal but who knows. This company seems pretty shady to me.","title":"If I could give zero stars","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=43&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-04","author":"Kristin","text":"I loved the YSL Clutch I ordered but was so disappointed that it had stains on it.

I had been selling on them for a while. Super slow on process. You can have your items shipped out for weeks and it still listed as processing. I requested my Chanel bag return since it has been ever sold, their associates texted me told me that the bag was sent out on the way back to me, never got a confirmation email or tracking.  It has been 2 months since they told me that bag was sent out. Then they keep me on the call for forever, keeping sending me to different department. Each time they ask my email address what I call for just so I can give up my request.  Christina, one of their associates, told me she was going to send help, never once I got an email back. Then she cannot pick up calls ....  I question if they are using those sale items doing other business. Pulling an item off a warehouse should not be this difficult unless they rented out. Highly suggest checking on the company illegitimacy.","title":"Let me give a review for what the real\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=43&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-04","author":"customer","text":"The listing said it came with minor scuffs but it arrived with tons of scratches and dirt and dust all over, and it didn't come with a case and cleansing cloth as stated in the listing.","title":"Misleading photos of quality","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=43&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-04","author":"customer","text":"The bag you sold to me was fake!
