I had my sales girl at Herm\u00e8s verify it was not authentic too.  The company will not speak with me over the phone.  They have had the bag since 3\/3 and have yet to refund my nearly $13k....or even provide a store credit.

The item came in very quickly, although I had a scare that it was stolen due to the main box being busted in and damaged.  The product inside was fine, but it seemed like the box was just too big for the product box and UPS\/Fedex must have just stacked things on top.  \n\nAs far as the purse, it was a chanel black lambskin bag.  The post described the item as \"Very Good, Details:Light wear at interior; minor creasing at base.\"  When the purse arrived, the creasing was very prevalent at the base and it seems like as a designer store they would have at least stored it stuffed or attempted to prevent further form from messing up.  The other problem it had which wasn't mentioned is the top rims of the purse the leather was rubbed off nearly completely. I'm fine with used products, but the purse was far from very good, and it seems like this was intentionally overlooked.\n\nSlightly frustrated as it was my first purchase on the site, not sure I'll be a return customer as it was a bit of a surprise on the condition and the no - return policy could leave you with a far more damaged purse than you purchased and not being able to return it.","title":"The Chanel bag was purchased for my\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-18","author":"customer","text":"I paid extra for early shipping it\u2019s been a week still haven\u2019t Received my order","title":"I paid extra for early shipping it\u2019s\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-18","author":"customer","text":"For the amount of money we pay, especially over a thousand dollars, why should we pay shipping","title":"Paid Shipping?","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-18","author":"MARGO MOSES","text":"Shipping took a long time and I\u2019m in the same state.

The site can be good for buyers, as prices are competitive. It's awful for consigners, and it got worse over the years. On average I wait for two months for my Chanel and Hermes bags to be priced and listed on the site. I ALWAYS have to contest the pricing as they will try to go as low as possible. They claim applying some sort of pricing algorithm, which is bunch of bs. Customer Support is not responsive. I often have to write multiple times on the same issue to get a response. Overall the company seems to be super shady and lacks fundamental transparency and basic customer service. I'm officially done with RR as buyer and seller. Fashionphile and Poshmark is where I'll be selling from now on.","title":"Horrible Customer Service, Not Transparent Pricing, Super Slow Consignment processing times","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-19","author":"KimA","text":"I like the bracelet but the black detailing on the bracelet was a thin strip of plastic that was falling off.","title":"Not exactly what I expected.","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-19","author":"customer","text":"Slow to answer, lazy to answer, passive response, and evasive answers    To be honest, I feel really bad and disappointed","title":"Slow to answer lazy passive","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-19","author":"customer","text":"Purchase was easy and shipping was great.
