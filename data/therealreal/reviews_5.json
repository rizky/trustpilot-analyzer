How did The Real Real not notice this?!\n\nI ordered a size 11 boot, the website listed the boots as women's size 11, however when the boots arrived they were half the size l needed. Clearly the Real Real does not double check sizes before listing items. Anyone who knows shoe sizes could have seen by just looking at the boots that they were not a size 11.\n\nThis item was non returnable, even though they are the ones who misrepresented the item.

The shipping\/tracking could have been clearer - it said my package would be delivered by a certain date, but only one of my two items arrived and I had no idea when the second item would arrive. I had to chat with customer service to figure that out. One of the items I received had a hole in it and when I told customer service, they offered a $20 credit to the site that would be valid for only the next three days. This was a $195 piece of clothing that I had decided to keep and get mended, so I was a bit annoyed by that. Lastly, it wasn't made clear to me that the second item I ordered wasn't returnable - I only discovered that when I went to make my return and the only option was to consign the item.

I also benefitted from the accurate size guide suggestions. So I appreciated that. However, after buying this expensive item, I assumed that it would come packaged carefully. Unfortunately, that was not the case. My item (a pair of shoes) was thrown into one dust bag with a single piece of tissue paper dividing them. Further there was no tissue outside the dust bag in the box to make sure that the shoes were not tossed around and damaged in transit. This was a very real possibility since the box was large and had two tears at the sides. Since my item was not damaged, I am not dissatisfied, but I think you should be more thoughtful with how you package your items. I would have greatly appreciated the shoes coming in separate dust bags with tissue paper supporting not only both shoes but the inside of the box.

The description did not explain which would be a side zip and which was a front zip.  These pants from this brand are plentiful on your site.  It would be really helpful if description could note side zip or front zip.  So bottom line i had to send back two pair to return.
