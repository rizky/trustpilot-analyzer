However there was a very obvious white mark on the EPI leather that would not come off on the side of the bag. I had to touch it up with sharpie which will no doubt wear off in time.\n\nHappy with the site navigation and ease of use, but in this case the description\/condition was extremely misleading. Had the flaw been highlighted, I likely would have passed on the specific bag in favor of a more mint condition one.\n\nOrdered a wallet which will show up tomorrow.

I tried contacting customer service for additional info\/photos and was told she could get it for me and that she could hold the bag while we awaited the info, only for her to say she misspoke and wouldn\u2019t hold the bag. Never got more info. Purchased the bag basically blind, there was no mention of the smell, or the stains on the interior in the description. The bag arrived in a box with no padding, this is a $2,090 bag that I\u2019m paying $800 for banging around loosely in a cardboard box.
