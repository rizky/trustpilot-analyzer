I reached out to TTR saying other than the hole I liked the sweater & I cld have it hemmed but asked for a partial refund.  They just responded to me & said the sweater I ordered in Final Sale, no returns & would I like a $10 credit for a next purchase.  Firstly I didn\u2019t ask for a refund, or a credit, I asked for a partial refund for this particular transaction.  And just today I found another hole (also like the first not disclosed in the description).  If TRR doesn\u2019t settle this transaction properly, I don\u2019t want to be a return customer.  I never even used my $25 off $50 purchase welcome offer before it expired.  I\u2019m going to share all this with them & see how they handle it.  But buyers beware\u2026personally I know these are used clothes, but if damage is not disclosed there should be better consumer protection.  It should be up to the buyer to make the educated\/informed to buy a damaged good.  Not get a damaged good & then be asked to come back to spend more money on another item as a solution to remedy the first wrong.","title":"So far, no so good\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=48&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"Susan Bringardner","text":"The John Hardy bracelet was described as having blue sapphires which is why I purchased it.The sapphires are completely black so they don't go with my other sapphire jewelry.
