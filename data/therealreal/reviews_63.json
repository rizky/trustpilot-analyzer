It\u2019s got a killer selection of goods. The most thrilling of all was a gold band that I knew immediately was made to live another life as my wedding ring. I tested my ring size before ordering so I knew I was getting the right size. The order shipped as desired and I LOVED the look of my new ring! So far, 5 stars. However, it was too big and slipped off my finger. I\u2019m not an expert, so I thought I\u2019d made a mistake. I took it to two jewelers, and yep, the actual ring size was 9.5 - not a size 9 as listed on the website. For a company that prides itself on authentication, selling a size 9 ring that isn\u2019t actually a size 9 is a bit of an embarrassing hiccup. I still love the ring, so I coughed up almost $30 to get it locally resized. For a $300+ ring, that\u2019s another 10%. I wish they\u2019d sent me the right size in the first place.","title":"Right ring; wrong size!

I've made about 15 orders with them totalling around $5-6000 so not a high spender by any means. I've had good luck finding some amazing pieces I would not have found anywhere else and they give me access to brands we just don't have in Canada. What I have learned however is that whenever you buy it really is a gamble on what your going to get. I've had quite a few orders where items have come to me with significant damage, stains and holes,  none of which were listed in the description. I only buy items that are in minimum very good condition but aim more for pristine or excellent. Even then I have had items come with stains on them or with damage. I've also had items come that were measured incorrectly and therefore did not fit. They do offer returns on some items but being in Canada means I have to pay for shipping each time which is between $30 to 50 so it's not something I want to do often or even makes sense once you calculate the cost of shipping initially ($48.00) plus the return shipping makes it not worth it. The pricing they have on some items is way off especially considering majority of items are used, I've seen them charging the same if not more then retail for used items. For example, they had a women's Adidas baseball cap with no back for ponytails which is less then $50 brand new and both times I've seen the hat they had it listed for $144. So you definitely should be somewhat knowledgeable about prices if that matters to you. The shipping is fairly fast, usually order will arrive on 3rd day which is pretty impressive for international shipping. The customs for me are usually $10 or less for orders $300 -$400 so not bad at all. However, if you get an item that is new with tags customs will charge you based on the tag price not what you paid and so I've been nailed a few times with charges about $70 on those items. I think they should definitely start offering free shipping for orders over a certain amount like Revolve does, it would get them alot more sales imo. \nCustomer service is so so, anytime I have emailed regarding an item I recieved that had damage or stains they have never offered any compensation for me even if the item never listed any issues. They also take forever to answer you in the first place and sometimes I never get a reply back and will just keep emailing them until I do. \nAll in all I think they offer a tonne of products and ones that are rare , unique and a bargain compared to retail price but just keep in mind that you never know what condition the item will come in at the end of the day . They definitely have areas to improve in and hopefully they do. Longer cart timers would also be awesome because 20 mins is not long enough!","title":"Most of the time , great experience.","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=63&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-17","author":"customer","text":"No refunds and only 1 of 4 items fit.\n\nI ordered four pairs of pants with my exact measurements matching those in the item description.
