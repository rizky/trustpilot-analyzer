[{"date":"2022-03-23","author":"customer","text":"While I did love shopping with The Real Real, I'm unlikely to do it again because of the high shipping cost for international customers. Not to mention you have to pay taxes and duties which is quite pricey as well. You're already paying a high price for the items. Having high priced shipping as well just isn't realistic for international customers. If shipping became more affordable I would definitely shop The Real Real again.","title":"While I did love shopping with The Real\u2026","stars":3,"location":"JP","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=56&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-23","author":"customer","text":"Shipping takes a long time","title":"Shipping takes a long time","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=56&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-23","author":"customer","text":"I have to give a 3.
