I immediately called customer service and sought out return information even though it was over 40% off in a final sale. The customer service agent was outstanding and immediately sent me a return label and said that the return postage would be refunded even though not stated on the email with the return label.

First time, and sadly last time I will use TRR. I order a pair of YSL heels; my purchase arrived and I received two totally different shoes (not only were they two different styles, they were both right foot shoes!). I contacted customer service via email, and was sent a return shipping label to which they expected me to cover the cost. Had they shipped me the right item, I would have not returned in the first place so I did not feel responsible for any costs due to their mistake. I finally got a representative on the line who was able to credit my shipping cost, and let me know once the item was received back my full refund would then be issued. There was no attempt on their part to make it right, at all. They could have offered to correct the mistake and resend the correct item. I was really looking forward to my purchase.","title":"Bad experience","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=62&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-18","author":"Emm","text":"A friend who is a huge fan of TheRealReal recommended I consign with them. She told me upfront that she would also be getting a referral fee which I had no issue with. I had an in-home appointment to review my items in order to assess what was most saleable and in total consigned 13 pairs of designer shoes (Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo, Prada etc) and 20+ clothing items. Getting through to TheRealReal was a total nightmare. You cannot call direct and when you do, you are placed on an indefinite hold with a recording that your wait time is less than 10 minutes. I left my number for a callback that never came. When my items were finally published on the site, I was shocked to see how little they sold my clothing for! An Equipment silk blouse with sales tags attached sold for $40 for which I receive $12! I would've rather donated the item than sell it for $12. An Armani blazer that cost me almost $1000 and was worn once is listed for sale for $80 with a condition description stating there is piling throughout. Not only is that false, I will recoup a big $24! I am so upset, I have asked that some of my items be returned as I'd rather keep them or sell them on Poshmark. I was told there is a $15 per item fee to return them. I specifically questioned the rep who came to my house about any issue I may have with TheRealReal's pricing of my possessions and directly asked if I can have them returned if I do not agree with their suggested price. I was told it would not be a problem and I could request my items back. She never mentioned a charge to get my own clothes and shoes returned and when I called to question her, she told me well yes there is a $15 fee but I've never seen it charged to anyone. I am beyond distraught. I will likely look to have my remaining items sent back and will NEVER NEVER use them again. Thankfully I didn't give them my collection of designer handbags which if I choose to sell, will fetch far more on other resale sites.","title":"Extremely disappointing experience consigning my goods","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=62&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-18","author":"E.
