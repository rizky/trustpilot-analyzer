The last two orders were exceptionally poor. I ordered a pair of earrings which arrived with bent posts and in less than described condition. Yesterday I received a Louis Vuitton bag that only mentioned faint scratches on the hardware. They priced it nearly $500 above retail but being a discontinued bag I was willing to pay the premium. It has much more wear than described including a large stain on the leather strap. It was cleverly hidden in the photos. The icing on the cake was that they sent it with no signature required. I am fortunate enough to live in a building with a concierge who accepts all packages. As I paid nearly $2k it gives me pause. It\u2019s likely this will be my last purchase.","title":"My experience has been hit or miss","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=4&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"customer","text":"Mistakes happen, so I  wasn\u2019t angry about the error in the listing.
