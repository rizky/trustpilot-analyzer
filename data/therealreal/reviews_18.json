I paid shipping myself, Im okay with that. The problem is I cannot get my consignment item returned if it is not eligible for listing(even if I tried to pay for the return shipping cost) another thing is some of item description is slapdash, for example they often put an automatic watch in quartz watch category which make buyer confused. My item usually sold within a month here, that's pretty good, however the overall experience still need to be improved.","title":"consign experience in Canada","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=18&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"customer","text":"I bought 3 purses, 2 were great, one was horrible.","title":"I bought 3 purses","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=18&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"customer","text":"I ordered a Tod\u2019s bag that said was in very good condition.
