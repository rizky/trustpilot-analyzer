But the problem is that there are too many mistakes in the item descriptions. Often it is the measurements that are wrong, sometimes by a large amount. This time the dress I bought was listing as having a 100% silk lining. Unfortunately the dress was completely unlined. I was able to return the dress, and The Realreal paid for the shipping label, which I appreciate. But the whole thing could have been avoided in the first place. \nThe other problem is that once I have returned an item I see it listed with exactly the same description and measurements. Nothing has been fixed. This is very troubling and causes a lack of trust with future purchases. I really wish the company would take more care with accurate descriptions and measurements. Plus I have doubts about the authentication process.\nOne more thing - fixing the problem in the chat function takes a really long time. I feel like the worker is juggling a lot of chats at the same time.","title":"Too Many Mistakes","stars":2,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=32&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
