Despite the note packing slip that says \u201cyou can track the status 24\/7 on your My Sales page\u201d\u2026..there is no way to do this. The person who handled the consignment, Kennedy, my account rep has seemingly vaporized. We have had no response on any of this. This also is not the first time I have had an issue with consignments-- just prior to this consignment, there were several pieces that were posted mistakenly, to the account of the person who took the consignments in for me. That took weeks to resolve. Doesn't really want to make one send in expensive designer goods that seem to go into the ether.\n\nSome help would be appreciated.","title":"Consignor Relations?
