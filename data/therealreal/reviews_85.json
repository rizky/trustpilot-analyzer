I was skeptical about the authenticity of the bag and contacted customer service. I asked for documentation to verify the authentication process and they said they are understaffed because of Covid and could not provide. They offered for me to return the bag for authentication which is confusing because should they not have authenticated it before they put it up for sale?  It was described as in \u201cvery good\u201d condition but it does not look like it has ever been used. It even had blue plastic on the feet. Would no one have ever removed this and does LV even put plastic on the bag feet? Not sure what I will do, but probably will not purchase from them again. If it is authentic, it is amazing condition but cannot confirm and they were not too reassuring.","title":"First and Maybe Last Purchase","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=85&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-22","author":"Whitnee","text":"I was disappointed with my purchase.

When I received it I noticed the knot on the clutch was wobbly! And there were stains inside. None of the photos showed the stained side of the clutch and the description failed to mention the knot handle was barely holding onto a thread. Disappointed. I'm out $600 and I have to find someone to fix the knot. I should have known given all the bad news about this company. I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be a fake AND for this review to not show up on the website.
