[{"date":"2022-05-02","author":"Lynn","text":"Love the clothes offered, and my order was quickly shipped, in better condition than some other consignment sites I've tried. However, a big flaw, IMO, is that they hide in the fine print whether an item is returnable or not!!  You have to scroll down below the price listing and click on Shipments and Returns. Only after clicking on the fine print do you find the information on whether an item is returnable. Even when an item is in your cart, it does not say if an item is NOT returnable. This is a little devious to me, it should be very clear, particularly once an item is in your cart, whether it is returnable, or whether you are stuck with the item if it doesn't fit or is in bad shape. After contacting customer support, I did manage at least to get store credit for the unreturnable items I wasn't aware of. So still giving them 3 stars for doing the right thing.","title":"Love the clothes, but they hide returnability of items!","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=10&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-02","author":"Stewart","text":"Shoe sizes are not designated relative to e.g. US or UK.

Finally, I had enough and cancel my order to find out that the item has been missing from warehouse and no one can locate it. Terrible, terrible customer service, got hung up multiple times, on hold for like 45 minutes and such. I made another purchase of similar item since it wasn\u2019t exact what I wanted but whatever. Now these 2 items that I purchased came in tangled ( necklaces) in multiple knots. Took me 2 hours to carefully untangle them. The Real Real is not what it was 2 years ago.
