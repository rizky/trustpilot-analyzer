And then to beg for it to be sent was worse especially when I paid for the item and contacted the company 4 x. \n\nBut I believe it's all in how the problem is revolved...this is what my review is based off of. Giving a credit for a future purchase and not the one that missed the event is in poor taste for me. It would mean more to make up for error in missing my 50th birthday than make it into some gimmicky credit to keep me coming back. It could have brought me back to 5 stars....","title":"I know this is a pandemic but\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=97&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-06","author":"Dan","text":"Spent $2000 on a pre-owned bag. The shipper for the bag is too small, the bag itself(leather) was folded and Jam into the small shipper when it\u2019s arrived, bag was dirty and dusty, I had to wipe it down with a soft cloth myself but I\u2019d expect this could be done by the retailer, not too much to ask for a clean item when you spent thousands of dollars even it\u2019s pre-owned. Order a RealReal gift box with the item and never came with the shipment, got on the customer support and spent about 1 hour with the agent, answered hundreds of questions for a $5 gift box to determine it\u2019s not my fault the box didn\u2019t come, so I will receive a $5 credit but they will not send me the box.
