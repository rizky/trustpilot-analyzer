Super easy to filter for just what you're looking for. Only three stars because some items came which were not the advertised size.

The lining needs to be aired out as well - it's not a \"bad\" smell necessarily, but it has a faux-perfumey edge to it that's unpleasant to me. Not sure if I'll shop here again.

So customer service has two cards on their system but it doesn't show which one is current, so they submit the wrong one creating errors and unable to complete order. Also, their search function is garbage. If you want to have someone else order something for you as a gift, there is no way for them to find the item you want as the search function cannot search by item number, only by description. And trying to search on the item description can display hundreds of similar items without knowing which one is correct.","title":"Very poor user interface and unhelpful customer service","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=20&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-24","author":"customer","text":"No one helped me","title":"No one helped me","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=20&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-24","author":"Loretta Daniel","text":"Packaging was a complete mess!
