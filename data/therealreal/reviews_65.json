I was expecting better from what looked to be a reputable company.\nFirst of all, when I set up an account, I was given a new customer store credit of $25. I tried for several days to purchase a couple of items but no matter what payment method I tried or what device I used, it kept saying my payment was declined.\nI contacted customer service by email and they advised that something called an \"auto-block\" was put on my account. I buy and sell designer items, and I spend large amounts online all the time....I have no idea why they would block a new account without letting you know that there's a problem. I wasted hours trying to place the order, believing I was doing something wrong. They told me to wait 48 hours for them to remove the auto-block. \nSo I tried again 48 hours later and now my store credit had expired because of their incompetence and delays. \nI contacted customer services to ask if they would reinstate my store credit as it was an issue at their end that caused the delay and I received no reply whatsoever. I sent a follow-up message and, again, I've been ghosted. \nI don't think my request was unreasonable since I am fairly well-versed in customer service but, even if it were something they were not prepared to do, I'm flabbergasted at how such a big organisation would simply ignore their customers. A simple reply, whether yes or no, would have been enough.\nI feel so disgusted by their rudeness and complete disregard for basic customer service, that I will never use this company again and I leave this review and others to forewarn anyone thinking of buying from them.\nIt's yet another example of blatant unaccountability. They mess up and when you politely ask if they would rectify, they ignore you!!  As if their error hadn't cause enough inconvenience already.\nI've been in sales for over 18 years and I cannot imagine treating people in this way.\nI'm not some entitled rude person, demanding things I'm not entitled to. It's not even about the money, it's about the principle of it all. \nHave a bit of integrity and honour The RealReal. You may not care about the average person who's a relatively small customer, but if you alienate all of us, you'll soon be left without a customer base. Shame on you. \n\nAnd as I say in most of my reviews, PLEASE don't leave some lame message with an insincere apology asking me to contact you and you will happily resolve for me. We all know that it's a face-saving exercise, it's lies to make you look like you are taking care of the situation to those who read the review when, in actual fact, I'll be treated in the exact same way if I were to contact you again. I've already contacted you twice about the latter issue and I've been ignored, so contacting you again will get me no further. Disgusting, unprofessional and unaccountable.","title":"An horrendous experience as a new\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=65&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-15","author":"customer","text":"Item was absolutely perfect but they left the security tag attached.
