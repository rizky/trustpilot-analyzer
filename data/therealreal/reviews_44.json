These are all from designers I currently own. Some of the shoes are exactly as described. Two pairs however are not. Both of these pairs although my size, are so completely tiny and narrow that I cannot fit them on my foot. These are both designers I own and wear. There may be something wrong with the manufacturing on these specific pairs, but I feel that the fact that they are unnaturally narrow and small to the point that they cannot even be put on, should have been mentioned in the description. Instead it just says this designer fits a 1\/2 size small, which I already am aware of and in this case is not at all accurate.","title":"I recently ordered six pairs of shoes\u2026","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=44&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-04","author":"customer","text":"Shipping takes too long","title":"Shipping takes too long","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=44&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-04","author":"Arizona ","text":"Horrified at the fraud.","title":"Horrified at the fraud.","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=44&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-04","author":"Customer","text":"My husband bought 2 items from them, and I bought a bag.
