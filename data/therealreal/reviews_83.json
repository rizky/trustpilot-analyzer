I understand I purchased a vintage item and I was expecting a decent amount of wear and tear but the bag arrived peeling from every side, leather bits falling off when handled, the inside fabric completely detached from the leather interior with glue bits stuck all over from where it was once adhered. Even if I could get over the subpar condition, the worst part was the filthy state in which the bag arrived. There was female hair covering the inside of the bag, pieces of debris in every fold and tons of dust. I thought with how much The Real Real states that they perform a thorough inspection to authenticate every piece, they could at least do a quick cleaning! Perhaps a shake-out and vacuum? Felt like I bought it at a dirty flea market or something. I do not usually do reviews but this was my first time buying pre-owned designer items- is this the norm? I would have rather purchased a brand new bag that is not a designer for the same price. Oh well.","title":"I was super disappointed...","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=83&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-24","author":"First time customer","text":"My first purchase was not what I expected.

Everything looked great. When I went to try on, one of the blouses was super small...I looked at the tag and it said it was a size 3. I figured it was my mistake, so I checked what I had purchased--it said Large, which is what I was expecting. I reached out to customer service, and haven't heard back. It was on sale, so I cannot return it. Hoping it will fit someday, it is beautiful. I just wished someone would have responded...it was clearly an error on their part. I could be mistaken, but I don't believe a 3 = large in any sizing. I will order from therealreal again, however, I will be much more cautious next time.","title":"Mislabeled Items","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=83&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-24","author":"Mom of three girls","text":"First time user here.

I do not have time nor the patience to deal with the continuous errors and problems with my account as a new consignor.  furthermore as a buyer, I spent two weeks trying to find the width size of a pair of black Ferragamo riding boots. Finally I took a chance and just bought them only to find they were a AAA and too small. So I return them two weeks ago and still do not have credit back. Plus I found another pair of Ferragamo black riding boots and even though I used your text and went back-and-forth on another 10+ emails trying to find out the width size with no luck or response from anyone. Just a generic email that they would be in touch and that\u2019s been over A few weeks.  they advise me to go ahead and buy them and if they didn\u2019t fit I could return them. The scenario that I had just already been through.   Not to mention that you have to pay for a return.
