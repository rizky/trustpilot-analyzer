I have received offers other places which I should have pursued but had heard good things about the RealReal. I am extremely unhappy with the process and will definitely suggest my friends go elsewhere when consigning such high priced items. I would never consign with the RealReal again.

I returned it within the timeframe, but on my account, it says the order is not returnable.  WHAT?! I started a return well before the 14 day limit, and sent it back well before 21 days, and it's not eligible for a return?! Yes, I got 20% off this jacket, but it is eligible for return because it wasn't 40% off.  Why did you even issue a RMA and shipping label when the item turns out not to be returnable?  \n\nOn top of that, their shipping and returns policy is a ripoff. Almost $12 for shipped and $12 for returns? Along with ripping off people who sell on consignment?

I chatted with a sales rep \"Samar\" on 1\/22\/22 describing the problem and requested a full refund (item+tax+shipping = $94.73) - not the partial refund described on the RealReal site (item only, less return shipping and tax = $68.99). Samar indicated that because the item was not as described I would receive a full refund. I am still owed $25.74 for the item that the RealReal incorrectly described and sold to me. \nI notice that today the dimensions of this item are updated to 5.5\"(h) x 3.25\"(w), but it is still described as a \"card holder\". So it was partially updated online.

I wanted to purchase a black leather bag from a certain designer. The listing of the bag that I wanted to purchase featured a photo of the bag in black leather. The website states that the photos listed are the ones of the real item. However, the description of the bag said it was blue leather. I contacted TRR before purchasing to inquire about the discrepancy. The associate assured me that the bag was black leather, and if the bag that arrives is blue, I would have been eligible for a refund and return because it would have been an error on TRR. The purchase was a risk, but I figured that with my documented conversation and promise that I would be able to return if it were blue, I hesitantly spent $2K on the bag. The bag delivered was blue leather. I contacted TRR to initiate a return, only to find out that nothing could be done because the bag was described as blue leather on the product listing. The prior-to-purchase conversation was brought up and reviewed by the sales associate. Even after reading the correspondence, the BEST thing that they could offer me was to consign the bag back with TRR (which would have me lose A LOT of money on a bag that I never had worn). I purchased the product under false pretenses. This purchase was a lot of money and for a site like this, I would expect more professional and human customer service. I know I took a risk that the bag would have been in a different color, but the mistake was on TRR for two things: 1) not picturing the actual item for sale and 2) not staying true to their word. I will not be shopping on this site again and will advise friends to do the same.","title":"Misled and out $2K","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=98&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-05","author":"customer","text":"Received a pair of shoes that were listed and categorized as a size 8.

I purchased an Ebel watch that was supposedly in good condition and also evaluated by a horologist and that it met time keeping standards. Upon receiving the watch I immediately knew something was wrong. It was not keeping time. Took into an Ebel certified watchmaker, they changed the battery, and it still did not work. I can't return it because the product was \"final sale\" and it is VERY difficult find a customer service phone # or email and I am left sending a Facebook message. The watchmaker is now fixing the watch which is going to cost me another $400. I would NOT recommend the RealReal to anyone. It is unreliable and it is hard to imagine that all products are actually evaluated and authenticated thoroughly and by a qualified professional.","title":"Broken Watch","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=98&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-05","author":"kbsf","text":"A fur coat was supposedly rejected for consignment.

I'm most upset on the fact that I loved the purse but felt it was falsely advertised on its condition and color.  I purchased two pairs of shoes and felt the price was reasonable.  Both pairs matched their photos which I appreciate.  One pair needs some cleaning on the inside.  I was surprised that they weren't cleaned out before sent.  Now I understand that The Real Real isn't like an ebay or Poshmark seller that tries to make the product the best it could be for good reviews.  \n\nWith that, customer service was very kind to let me return the purse.  I'm still not certain if it was the same purse from the picture.  We returned the purse at the Marin store and the lady was absolutely hesitant about not accepting the return until she found the return number issued by customer service.  She was not happy about the situation.\n\nAfterwards, we purchased a different purse costing twice of what I originally invested in the first purse.  The sales person was aggressive with the handling of the bag.  So much so, I thought he might rip it or scratch it.  It was uncomfortable watching him struggle with the bag while he was trying to inspect it and look at it.  I was thinking he might be differently challenged yet for a high-end seller, I was surprised at how he handled the store merchandise.\n\nOverall, it was interesting \ud83e\udd14. There were lots of glitches along the way, but I kept a few of the items to see how I felt about buying second-hand luxury .  Not sure, though, if I am as eager to purchase from The Real Real as I was for my first purchase.\n\nI'm adding to my review.  One, the lady at the Marin store who took our items was very nice and had fabulous customer service.  I would go back and buy something just because she was so helpful and customer service oriented.\n\nLastly, I just cleaned out the gunk in the Tod's mules.  As I was cleaning out the dirt and grime, I realized both shoes are completely broken.  I'll call customer service, but I'm surprised at the quality with gunk and dirt in the shoes and the fact that they're both broken and unwearable and a dirty stained purse (I still think it's the wrong purse sent) that looked nothing like the photos.","title":"I was surprised that the purse I bought\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=98&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-05","author":"BF","text":"I really wanted to like this company.
