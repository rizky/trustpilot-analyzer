You can find excellent condition to new items at reasonable prices. Customer service is good once you get a hold of someone.\n\nHowever here are some cons:\n1. Clothing size is a hit or miss. Even when the item states \"new with tags\" or \"pristine\" that doesn't mean the item has no flaw. I've experienced it where the brand size is different from TRR's size and material description. Or the \n2. Returning an item is such a pain and costly.\nTRR charges shipping cost of $12.95 and $11.95 for return of each item in the same order! So if you have multiple items in one order, with different shipping\/arrival date, and you choose to return one of the items before you receive the rest, you will get charged $11.95 for that return. Then say the rest of the items come another day and choose to return another item, you will get charged another $11.95 to return it. How ridiculous does that sound? \n3. Return window is only 14-21 days depending on shipment and return date. \n3. Order cancellation - you have to contact TRR within 15 minutes to guarantee cancellation otherwise, even if your order is still under \"Confirmed\" status, if you wait til the next day, they cannot guarantee cancellation. This sucks when you place an order after customer service closes at 8 pm ET. You would have to try and chat with someone - if they are available then you might get lucky.\n4. Customer service via phone is Mon-Fri from 8-8 pm ET. How about folks in PT time zone? It should be extended until 8 pm as well PT. During weekends, you can only contact a live agent via chat. \n5. Refund can take weeks to receive!","title":"Inaccurate clothing size description, diffcult return process","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=68&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-12","author":"customer","text":"It\u2019s been two months and I still don\u2019t have one of my items listed or sent back.

I couldn\u2019t even fit my toes through the opening and the RealReal product description even said that Gucci loafers typically ran large. Im fine with returning them, I get that some products don\u2019t work out, but not exactly happy that I had to pay shipping to order it AND return them.

Exactly what I ordered and expected.\n\nThe other half was simply dishonest. The sizes ordered did not match the sizes sent. A specific waist and inseam was clearly listed on the item's page. The tags of the items sent did not match the listings. Moreover, the actual size of the items sent did not match the listings.\n\nOne pair of pants falls straight off me because it is far too large. The other pair of pants are so long I stand on the cuffs.\n\nI can understand a mistake. That's no issue. However, to require processing fee is crazy. The policy allows the store to simply send you whatever and crank fees. Now I understand much of that goes to third-party shipping costs, so there's little financial incentive to do that for most items. \n\nHowever, it renders inexpensive items unreturnable. The policy can even work to charge the customer for the store's mistake. Any item close to or under $12 simply cannot be purchased from the site with this policy in effect. \n\nNo returns is fine. But no free returns when you receive the wrong item?

As a seller, I guess I expected a little bit more. The consignment home-pickup thing is GREAT and I even had a long, very enjoyable convo with the local rep, who is awesome. And I understood TRR would handle the pricing, but i was told my commission tier was 55% and I am getting 30%. The pricing is baffling -- I just got $12 dollars for a NWT $600 dress. The amount of marketing email pressuring people to make purchases is over the top, it's like 4 emails a day. I was hoping this would be a little bit more of a win-win, and maybe over time it will be, but I'm really underwhelmed and had i known in advance how little money i'd see for my items, I would probably not have done it.","title":"disappointing so far.","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=68&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-12","author":"customer","text":"I purchased expedited shipping for $30 on a Friday afternoon.
