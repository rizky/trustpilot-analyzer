I was told once I sent in my bag, it would be authenticated.  The set sales price would then be emailed to me      & I could either accept it or have my bag returned to me.\n\n2.  I was given a UPS label from Nichole, which didn\u2019t work & I was unable to reach her, so UPS created a new label with TRR\u2019s info from their system.  I then contacted Nichole with a copy of the new tracking number from UPS, on 3\/21\/22.  She confirmed receipt 3\/21\/22.  Therefore, she had a tracking number to LINK TO MY PACKAGE BEFORE IT ARRIVED, which she states later is how TRR keeps track of them in house.\n\n3.   UPS delivers package to TRR on 3\/24\/22\n\n4.  She doesn\u2019t respond to my calls or texts until 3\/29\/22, when she asks for a copy of the shipping label, provided to her on 3\/21\/22, then says that must be the problem.  She says she will need to open a support ticket, but the UPS tracking number that she had on 3\/21, was the issue for \u201cthe disconnect\u201d.\n\n5.  Nichole didn\u2019t turn in the support ticket, according to reps I spoke to later, nor did she return\/answer phone calls or texts again.\n\n6.  4\/01\/22 I spoke to rep #2 who looked for my information\/bag\/ticket & found nothing.  She found the ticket created by Nichole on Nichole\u2019s desk, her words not mine & the ticket had not been entered into the system.  She said she would do it.\n\n7.  4\/06\/22 I call again & speak to rep #3.  She also does not find ANY action to find my bag.  She says she will take over my case & find out what is going on.\n\n8.   4\/12\/22 i speak to Steven who asks me to send him pictures of my bag so he can look into it.  I send them.  He says he will get something done & get back to me.\n\n9.   4\/14\/22 I get an email saying my bag is enroute to the authenticator & it would be a couple of weeks before I would hear back.  Their policy states & I was confirmed, that after it was authenticated, I would be contacted with a proposed sales price which I could accept or ask to have my bag sent back to me.\n\n10.  4\/15\/22. I get an email saying my bag was sold & I would be getting a payout.\n\n**It was not sold, it was deemed as LOST, which means you get whatever they deem the bag to be worth at 50-70%.  You have zero say in the matter!**\n\nThis entire process was deceptive.  TRR seems to do this on a regular basis to many of their consignors.  Please look into their practices.  Read their FB comments.  This happens over & over again, same scenario as mine.\n There are many other platforms to sell on who pay more & at much less risk.  Please, don\u2019t take my word for it but do your research\u2026THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH THEM.  Read their own FB page comments.\n  (I\u2019d be happy to share evidence of every single statement I made.)","title":"Consigning with The Real Real, DON\u2019T","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=27&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-18","author":"customer","text":"Communications need a huge improvement!
