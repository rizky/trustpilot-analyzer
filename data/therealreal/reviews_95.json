[{"date":"2022-02-08","author":"customer","text":"I'm so disappointed to be writing this review. I had trouble from the beginning to end with my purchase. When I originally went to check out, the website kept backfiring on me and did not accept my credit card, paypal or debit card. It also did not accept any coupon code I used, even though all were eligible. Once I received my item after fast shipping, I realized I accidentally purchased the wrong bag. It was my fault for not reading the description closely enough, but there was also a glitch in the website that customer service did not take responsibility for. I kindly asked for at least store credit back and none of my requests were met. I don't think I'll be returning, unfortunately.","title":"I'm so disappointed to be writing this\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=95&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-08","author":"customer","text":"I love my bag but it was not cleaned.

Someone came to my house to go through my items. They took almost 60 items, left a few behind. Now they\u2019ve returned most to me in SIX different shipments - so far. I don\u2019t mind them not accepting the items, but they should train their employees better so they don\u2019t ship back so much. They don\u2019t take most Tory Burch, Trina Turk, Elie Tahiti, etc. and their employees should know that. It\u2019s ridiculous and a waste of time and money - incredibly inefficient. I\u2019m going to make so little from what they kept, I might as well have donated the clothes to Goodwill in the first place","title":"What a waste of time!!!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=95&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-09","author":"Nikole Graham","text":"bag was sold as excellent no visible sign of wear. but the leather has bubbled!
