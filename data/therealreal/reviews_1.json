[{"date":"2022-05-09","author":"First time customer","text":"The three pairs of shoes I ordered didn't fit, which is not that big of a deal, but I didn't realize how stressful the return process works be. Because the shoes took a week to get to my house, I had two weeks for the return to arrive back at realreal. With having a normal life and shoe returns not being my #1 priority, it took me a few days to get the package ready, and now I'm freaking out wondering whether it'll get there on time. Regardless of whether the realreal end up honoring my return or not. This has been a horrible stressful experience, not the granola \"do nice by mother earth\" experience I for some strange reason expected. On top of that, the one pair of shoes that is non-refundable throws an error on realreal when I try to consign it with no explanation. Maybe it's not consignable, but the website sends me in circles through the consignment flow.","title":"The three pairs of shoes I ordered\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=1&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-09","author":"customer","text":"Very poor quality control.

The language about my sale being final was small and at the very bottom of the product page.\n2. Neither the checkout page nor my order confirmation said anything about Final Sale.  I only discovered it was not returnable when it didn't fit and I went to return it.\n3.  My email inquiry to customer service 1 week ago has still not been answered.\n4.  A friend suggested I use the 'text' feature which -- after a long and super-frustrating runaround with not one, but two \"bots\" -- delivered me to a person.  But the first person was impossible to understand. \"Send me a picture of the product page\"...which I did 4x and still had them saying \"send me a picture\".  This led to a connection with another real person, who basically said, \"Oh.  I can't help.  It's not returnable.\"  \nBuyer beware.  The stuff is authenticated but be sure to note if it's returnable or not.","title":"So many things went wrong with my most\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=1&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-09","author":"Alexandra Bukojemsky","text":"Overall my experience with TRR has been good, always good customer service and consignment is easy. However the knowledge behind consignment is not always the best- I've seen things on the website that are vastly overpriced, while I've had things (like a Margiela long vest\/ coat) sell for far below their value. \n\nIf I could recommend 2 things:\nGive sellers the opportunity the see the prices before they are listed\/ made public. This would catch error (such as the 1k margiela vest being sold for $140). Also tell sellers what the earnings would be- I'm about to go up to 60% earnings (where I have been before) but have no ideas where this will actually take place. \nLastly, shipping should be free.
