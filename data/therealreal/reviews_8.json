I can\u2019t even return or exchange it for something else \u2018cause it\u2019s a final sale. The RealReal, did y\u2019all do this intentionally? Selling items that are falsely advertised, knowing very well that the customer won\u2019t be able to return it? You just lost a customer right there.","title":"Misleading Listing Description \ud83d\udc4e","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=8&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-03","author":"customer","text":"My account was charged for a Chanel purse I wanted and the purse wasn't completed as sold.
