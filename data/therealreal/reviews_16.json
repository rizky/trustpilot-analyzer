[{"date":"2022-04-26","author":"Lorna K","text":"I have bought a lot from TRR. Mostly a success, I had failures but I ended up giving it away. The 2 North Face ski pants were not well described as ski pants. It also has ski lift ticket and human hair and pets hair. Please make sure you walk  used clothes before selling it. Disgusting.\n\nThe Missoni purse looked like a cheap jacquard material and very slouchy. Again, for the sake of the environment I will not return it, will use it for a while and may give it away. \n\nThe candles are quite beautiful and artistic. Too expensive for me to burn it. \n\nI guess I\u2019ll stop shopping for a while. I\u2019m getting all misses.","title":"I have bought a lot from TRR","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=16&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-26","author":"customer","text":"just arrived, it is smaller than I expected (not really a US 4, more like a 2) but  the item is otherwise as described","title":"smaller than expected","stars":3,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=16&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-27","author":"customer","text":"I reported part of a missing order and was never responded to.","title":"I reported part of a missing order and\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=16&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-27","author":"Katie O","text":"Incorrect size was shipped!","title":"Incorrect size was shipped!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=16&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-27","author":"customer","text":"The security tag is still on the bag that I received.
