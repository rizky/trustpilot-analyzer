They\u2019ve gotten way too large. There is so much inventory that you can\u2019t wade through it to really find what you want. At the very least, the ability to narrow results down by items\u2019 condition. But, even that wouldn\u2019t be enough, because I\u2019ve received so many things that have been categorized as \u201cvery good\u201d condition that are far from it. I\u2019ve received shoes that were sized for a man, but sold as women\u2019s footwear. I\u2019ve received earrings that ended up being so odd I could not even determine how to put them on - when I finally got them on, one fell apart. It\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been pleased with a purchase I\u2019ve made with the Real Real. I\u2019m actually incredibly disappointed in what they have become. They used to be upscale. No longer. Their focus is on bringing in as much stock to sell as possible, and getting it out as quickly as possible. Due to this, they accept items in poor shape, and do a shoddy job with their listing descriptions and details. And, I can also say they bamboozle you if you consign. I consigned many high end items and got barely anything in return, which makes me sick. Never again. It\u2019s a mass market clearing house now, which is sad. I miss the original Real Real - the REAL real real.","title":"Mass market clearing house","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=61&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-19","author":"customer","text":"The purse was filthy!
