As a seller, the service is sub par. My rep told me 5 minutes before our meeting that she wasn't going to be coming. Her boss ended up having to cover for her, which worked out ok. \n\nHowever, I was also told that once the items were processed, I'd have a chance to review and nothing would go live without me approving it first. Not true. There is no stop point to allow you to review the items. They expect you to just constantly be looking at your account to catch the items they've processed. If you want it back, you have to reach out to your rep (who is unresponsive and hard to get a hold of) to ask them to manually remove the items for you and ship them back. That's IF you happen to catch the items before they go live and get sold. Which happens without any notification. Again you're just supposed to somehow be constantly monitoring your account. \n\nFinally, their commission structure is a bit deceiving. My sales page says in large font that I have 55% commission. What it doesn't make clear is that that is ONLY if the item is priced over $196. Below that, your commission is less - between 30-50%. So then what ends up happening is most of your items get priced with a cap of $195. \n\nI gave 2 stars because I do think they do a lot of work in processing items, and because of their wide audience, things that get listed seem to get sold pretty quickly (which actually may be a negative if you had any doubts or decided you want some items back - they'll probably be sold before you get the chance to check on your account). I just wish their process and service were better and clearer so that the sellers are made to actually feel valued.","title":"Selling with The Real Real","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=94&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-11","author":"customer","text":"All has been great except for my first order.
