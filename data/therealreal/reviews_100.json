Clearly, the person doing the listing never looked at the items. For example a sheared mink with brooches from J. Mendel was listed as a graphic print jacket not even mentioning it was fur. Said it was slightly worn, it was only worn twice and pristine. There were other items like this. Also items I didn\u2019t own were listed as mine. A very poor job that I believe cost me money. Also there was no negotiation on the compensation. I believe I should have had the privilege of discussing this.","title":"While you did compensate me","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=100&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-02","author":"customer","text":"It did not seem like someone from the Real Real was actually answering my email and they didn't help me resolve my problem.

They use WhatsApp to 'deal' with customer issues.  You are passed to a new person each time who has no clue what happened before them.   My return\/refund process started Jan 23, and is still ongoing.  I have now dealt with 8 representatives, had it 'escalated' numerous times, and have had it 'discussed with the team' about 10 times.  And yet this group just can't seem to return\/refund my account despite the clearly high level people working 24\/7 on it.  I will not shop or recommend anyone ever shop here again.  And hey RealReal, I get that you don't really want to talk to people, but if it gets this far, and the person on WhatsApp is demanding a voice telephone call, the least you can is acknowledge it. Id also like to point out that WhatsApp has a call feature.","title":"Returns are a nightmare","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=100&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-02","author":"customer","text":"The earrings were faded and the studs were crooked.

It was advertised as \"with tags\" and in \"pristine condition\". First time ordering from The RealReal. Had to fight to get a return label. The service rep swore I would be refunded for my entire purchase (including shipping to and from my house) but the RMA form shows that they did not refund the initial $12.95 shipping and are charging me $11.95 for return shipping. While speaking with the rep, I asked for proof in writing that I would be refunded for my entire purchase (including shipping) and would not be charged for return shipping, but he could not provide it. I do not trust this company at all and would NEVER purchase from the Real Real again. Time will tell if I will get a full refund for a \"pristine\" dress that was damaged beyond repair with a giant 5 inch hole I could get my hand through. So much for the \"most trusted resource for authenticated shopping\".
