[{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"customer","text":"Okay so \u2026\u2026 I like the concept behind this store and I like the affordability of it. They shipped my item super fast which I appreciated. Now , when it comes to luxury items being delivered I expect a bit more care when it comes to packaging, especially because bags tend to lose their shape and many of the ones sold here are older so I expected some sort of care when packaging and for my bag to be filled with at least paper to ensure the shape remained intact during the delivery process which did not happen. Now my biggest complaint they do not check the bag to ensure it\u2019s clean , my bag arrived smelling like it had been at a garage on the floor for months , I had to hand wash it for at least an hour to stop the water from coming out brown and full of dirt. On that end I\u2019m happy I got my bag but it took unexpected work to make it look decent.","title":"Okay so \u2026\u2026 I liked the concept","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"felipe villegas","text":"Por customer service, price items below price, takes a long time to received your payment","title":"Por customer service","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"customer","text":"order naver arrived, delivery date changed after out for delivery","title":"order naver arrived","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"customer","text":"I really don\u2019t like buying from the RealReal because of their fees and such that they subtract from my refund amount.","title":"Can I get my entire amount refunded???","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-07","author":"customer","text":"The photos in the listing did not show the extent of the damage to the hardware.
