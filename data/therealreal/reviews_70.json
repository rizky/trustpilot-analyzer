When the Kate Spade shoulder bag I ordered arrived I realized that it might not be a real Kate Spade. One of the snaps doesn\u2019t line up when trying to close the purse, which is a poor level of quality you would not find in an authentic designer bag. So I did research on genuine Kate Spade bags, and found a number of examples that the bag I paid for is fake, such as the brand label being a separate metal label that is glued onto the bag instead of the embossed label that is the only way Kate Spade labels their leather bags. I did not know any of this before ordering as I believed the site\u2019s authenticity guarantee. The item is \u201cfinal sale\u201d which is even worse. I cannot use the bag, since anyone who knows what an actual Kate Spade bag looks like (I didn\u2019t, I trusted the site) will know that I am carrying a fake bag. Very very upsetting that a site that in its very name guarantees that designer items are the genuine brand is selling fake merchandise. I have ordered a number of things before and have really enjoyed them; I don\u2019t know if this was a fluke but if it can happen I once it is really hard to be confident in the guarantee.","title":"Bag was not authentic","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=70&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-10","author":"customer","text":"The appraised prices are low.
