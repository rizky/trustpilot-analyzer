The purse was very cheaply made and a obvious knock off. The site states that they have experts that review authenticity but in this case this $900 purse was made of patent leather had plastic straps and burlap on the inside. The original purse was leather with gold metal straps and leather on the inside. The shade was not even available by that designer that they sent me. Even though the sites says all sales are final they did refund me my money for the fake purse. I actually took it back to the store to get the refund and they did have real purses in the store, they just didn\u2019t send me one.","title":"Fake purse","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=59&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-21","author":"Miriam","text":"Some flaws details weren\u2019t mentioned\u2026 disappointed","title":"Some flaws details weren\u2019t mentioned\u2026\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=59&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-21","author":"customer","text":"I paid a lot of money for a damaged item and the damage was not listed in the description of the item.

I sent an email with pictures and also called customer service then finally reached someone via text. It turns out that the top I ordered was no longer available. Why would TRR decide to send me a similar top instead of notifying me that the one I ordered was not available? It was the same brand, color and fabric but a different style.

I finally got it resolved but what a waste of time and effort to end up with nothing. Finally, I would like to believe that receiving the wrong shirt was an honest mistake, but what bothers me is that the one I ordered was NOT available, so it\u2019s not the case of someone accidentally packing a similar shirt.
