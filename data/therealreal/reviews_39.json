So, I think this is just average.","title":"While I have made some good purchases\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=39&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-07","author":"L Allen","text":"1 of 3 items in an order has been missing for almost two weeks.

Clothing is mis-labeled regarding size; or key measurements are mistaken. Since choosing the right size depends on measurements (sizing even for a single designer often varies significantly) measurements and sizing need to be correct and precise. \nAlso, policies regarding shipping are inconsistent and frustrating.\nFinally, texting the \"concierge\" is a joke. I'm not even sure if I have a real person because so often they do not understand what I am saying and I have to explain over and over.","title":"Great selection of clothes, BUT...","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=39&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-07","author":"customer","text":"All of the pieces were in the expected condition except the Supreme NY Puffer. It had pen marks on the sleeve, and a pink stain on the front, so that was disappointing. Also the box it was shipped in either was tampered with by the mail service, or just really crappy. The tape was barely holding the box closed. I suggest being more honest about the quality of items regarding stains\/discolorations, and better packing tape.","title":"Supreme Puffer Coat had stains that were not described. :(","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=39&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-07","author":"customer","text":"The item was not in good condition.
