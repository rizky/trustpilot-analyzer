I was told that you sold certain items and was encouraged to send them to only have them denied because you do not sell them. It took weeks to finally get them returned to me. I sent in a $3k in retail value RL Purple Label Tuxedo with the tags on it for you to separate it, Mia label the items as a blazer and dress pants, and sell it off for a fraction of the value. I was told by someone on the phone and in email that you would supplement the amount owed to me to compensate for the error but I never have received these funds after the blazer sold. When it was returned you had an opportunity to pair the tuxedo as it should be but instead you sold the jacket again while the pants remain marked as \u201caccepted\u201d looking like there is no intention to try and sell them. The entire experience has me never wanting to consign or purchase from your platform.","title":"Extremely disappointed","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=80&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
