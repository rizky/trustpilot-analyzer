So I texted customer service again and they had to make a custom UPS label.

It was my fault for putting my old address, but I recognized my mistake within 5 minutes of placing the order. When I went to view my order, it said to email real real support for help- which I immediately did. I then got an email the next day saying my order has shipped- but I had not gotten a response customer service. I immediately called the shipping company and they said they had no actually received the shipment yet, and the the real real has full access to change the shipping address. I then contacted the real real via chat- and the person told there was nothing he could do- even though the shipping company said your company has the ability to change it. When I explained this to the rep- he said he couldn\u2019t do anything but cancel my order and have it shipped back to the warehouse house- then I would have to rebuy the items once they are re listed on the real real. I contacted an event a second time and she said she would have the items reshipped to me. But no tracking has been updated and it\u2019s been a week. This is the worst system I\u2019ve ever experienced and I am very I likely to use the real real again or recommend it to anyone.","title":"worst online shopping","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-20","author":"customerJulia","text":"I ordered a box of never used Cartier stationery, labeled pristine.

I returned a pair of shoes which you received and have relisted.  However, you have still not returned my money.\n\n3.  It is literally IMPOSSIBLE to communicate with you via chat, text, or phone.\n\n4.  Your virtual assistant does not even recognize my order number?\n\n5.  After starting a virtual chat, you find out you are not talking to a person and one will get back with you when they are (good and) ready...not when the customer is already waiting (just go about your day is the message you receive ????)\n\n6.  I love the RealReal...consigning and purchasing, but this is getting to be too much.
