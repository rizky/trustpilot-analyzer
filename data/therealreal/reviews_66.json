Received the glasses, they were damaged as well as looked cheap for being Gucci glasses. The emblems were plastic and the lens was not stamped. It gave me the hunch they were not real.  I drove 45min to have them authenticated based on a hunch.  Thank goodness I did!  The Gucci store found them to be bad copy counterfeits.  I immediately emailed them let them know I received fake counterfeits.  I packaged them to be sent back!  I received an email on a Saturday which Was great!  That\u2019s about the only good thing that came out this transaction.  They waived the fees associated with a return.  They apologized but the damage is done.  I do not trust them now.  A quick search on the internet would have shown me to not trust them.  There are plenty of articles stating they are known for having counterfeit items. I usually shop on another online app but thought I\u2019d try this one.  Lesson learned.  I\u2019m so crushed as I loved the glasses but I refuse to pay over $150 for a pair of counterfeit eye ware.  I hope they figure out what is going on in their company whether it be more training or penalizing employees who authenticate fake items but something needs to be done.  Their reputation is definitely affected.  They lost a client in me.  Based on the waiving of the fees and Saturday customer service I give them a star otherwise they would one.","title":"Trusted them and was let down","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=66&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-14","author":"JLB","text":"So very sad that the condition of the handbag I received is far worse than \"slight discoloration\" as described.
