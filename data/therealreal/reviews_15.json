The dress I ordered was listed as XL on the site, but when it arrived it was very clearly labeled a size 12 by the designer. If it had been listed as a 12 on the site, I never would have ordered it because I know a 12 is most likely too small for me in a dress of that style. But since it was posted as XL, I took a chance that it would fit. I\u2019m not sure why the real real considers a size 12 to be extra large, but in this case time, effort, transportation, labor etc. were wasted simply because someone could have \u2014 and should have \u2014 but didn\u2019t list the dress as it was marked: size 12.\n\nIt was easy enough to return the dress since there is a store near me where I was able to drop it off, but if I had shipped the dress back to them, I would have been charged $11.95 for shipping\/handling. My advice is to read the fine print, make sure clothing that doesn't fit can be returned, and think carefully about how a style will fit your shape. Almost everything I've seen online and in store seems smaller than what you'd typically expect for the size listed (not uncommon with high-end designer merchandise, but something to be aware of). \n\nI've sold\/consigned numerous pieces with them and done much better on that front -- though I do think they sometimes are too quick to markdown an item, which leads to less commission for the seller.","title":"Sizing is misleading","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=15&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-27","author":"Sarah","text":"Beautiful scarf but only give 3 stars as it was listed as \u201cvery good\u201d condition with no flaws mentioned or photographed.

Unfortunately, one of the items in my order had some pretty significant damage that wasn't mentioned or pictured in the item description. It has happened before with other items I have purchased, in that there may be a little hole, but nothing that can't be fixed, so it hasn't been a big deal. However, this time, describing the item as having \"moderate wear\" and not include a significant defect is deceitful. I, unfortunately, won't be able to wear this item because the damage is pretty noticeable and unfixable, unless a MAJOR alteration is made to the item. I have already reached out to the Customer Service team with some pictures and hoping to find a solution. A situation like this won't deter me from continue buying items from The RealReal, but it will make me more weary of trusting the description. And while on this note, I had sent in a pair of Prada Wedges to sell, they were in what I thought pretty good condition, no defects, no major issues, other than light wear, and it was sent back to me. The fact that I couldn't consign those shoes and I've seen shoes in far worse shape listed and I received an item with actual damage, it's very disappointing. I think it's time to add more transparency to the product descriptions.","title":"Damaged Item","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=15&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-28","author":"Kim in FL","text":"Received 2 of 3 items ordered. One was clearly a fake-the most basic glance at the hardware and straps shows it\u2019s not an authentic Prada bag. It looks like a poorly done knock-off. I reached out twice to find out the process to return the fake and have yet to get a response. \n\nIn the meantime I received bag #2 of 3 ordered (ordered before I received the fake bag).  While it looks better and the emblem is consistent with authentic bags, the quality of the leather is suspect. It is practically flaking off in places. I have yet to receive bag#3. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have high hopes considering my experience with this company thus far.  All three bags were expensive and based on the reputation of TheRealReal I expected high quality used authentic bags.  It\u2019s been a thoroughly disappointing experience and I\nI am sure I\u2019ll never consider buying \u201cauthentic used\u201d bags online again. This is my first and last experience. It\u2019s quite disappointing, when I found this site and perused the bags I thought I\u2019d found heaven. Beautiful, hard to find gently used authentic luxury bags at a reasonable price point? Jackpot! That excitement lasted until the moment I received the first order. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m looking for a refund or at a minimum a re-assessment of the (fake) Prada backpack. The remaining bag on the order is due to arrive today. I hope it doesn\u2019t prove to be a fake.\n\n  I\u2019d recommend saving your money until you can afford to purchase the bag you want new directly from an authorized retailer, preferably the actual brand\u2019s store.","title":"Buyer be ware.
