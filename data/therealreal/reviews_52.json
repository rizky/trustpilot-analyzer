It has now been 18 days that they have had my payment, and yet the package tracking information informs me that a shipping label was printed but that the necklace has not yet left the warehouse.  Ironically, I did see the notification that my purchase is now outside of the window to qualify for returns.  Extremely disappointed.  The only feedback from the company was to reimburse me for shipping and tell me that they are going to request a \"rush\" on the order.","title":"I purchased a necklace on March 10","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=52&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-28","author":"customer","text":"I ordered a jacket that was listed as size L, and when it arrived it was an XS.

One of the deciding factors in making my purchase was that it said that the dress was in box. I can say that many people who order designer prefer when things are in box or original dust bag. When my package arrived, I found that my dress was not in box as stated on the website and on my packing slip. On top of that, the dress I ordered was white and wrapped in black tissue paper inside of a poly bag. It would be one thing if the dress was placed inside of dust bag from The Real Real, but it was left to chance that it wouldn't be damaged. For making a purchase that is considered final, I find this unacceptable and quite out of character. I did contact customer service and they were very kind. They refunded my shipping cost in the form of store credit. While this is nice and appreciated, I still wish I had the box. Please double check before sending future orders.","title":"I am giving this 3 stars because I'm\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=52&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-28","author":"customer","text":"Placed my order with a signature required for delivery.

And anything I put into this bag including my wallet sticks to whatever this is.  I've tried cleaning the liner but nothing has seemed to work.  The exterior of the bag was in good shape.  But both the smell and the sticky residue aren't easily remedied and will make me second guess any future purchases I make with The Real Real in the future.
