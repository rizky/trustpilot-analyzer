The only issue listed was bent arm on them, which I was fine with.  When I received it in the mail the first warning sign that this was a bad buy was the case they came in.  It was absolutely disgusting and dirty.  I really didn't even want to touch it.  When I got to the glasses.....ummmm...wow.  There was a scratch so big and deep in one lens you can't even see out of it.  The arm was bent but I expected that but was also scratched up and 75% of the jewels on it were missing.  These glasses should never have made it on the site.  The only place they belong is the trash.  They should have at least given an honest description and listed them as poor.  Not impressed and out the shipping $$.","title":"Description Not Accurate","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=78&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-02","author":"customer","text":"Sizes were way off and unreturnable.

I purchased a pair of sneakers during their special credit promotional period. When I received them and after further inspection and third-party authentication I was Made aware that they are a replica and not authentic. I contacted the real real Customer service and I spoke to someone named Hazel who is a Service specialist by title. There were other items part of my order and this made me eligible for the promotional credit if I return these I\u2019m no longer eligible but I purchased them just so I could be eligible for this promotional. Nevertheless he told me to return them and that I will not be getting any kind of credit which is fine if I was purchasing what they were advertising however their authentication system failed and now the customer is suffering and being punished. For this headache and their failed authentication system they should be able to still honor the value of my original purchase even if I return to them these take an authentic and replica shoes. I have been a customer with them for the last seven years and over the last couple months they have had inventory issues authentication issues and therefore not only do I not want to purchase from them I will also no longer sell with them absolutely horrendous service.","title":"Having an AWFUL experience with\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=78&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-02","author":"customer","text":"bad service from customer service","title":"bad service","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=78&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-02","author":"customer","text":"The item I purchased was supposed to have one minor snag in fabric.
