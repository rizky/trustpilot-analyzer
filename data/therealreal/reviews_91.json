Though, based on my last order (February 2022), a few items were overprized given their conditions. For example, I paid almost $50 for wool pants which had a tear and were repaired and it was not even mentioned in the description. I returned the item, but was not expected to get pants with mended holes. The return policy is good, -$12 for shipping back though.","title":"I hope the pricing will get better","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=91&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-14","author":"Lisa","text":"I didn\u2019t get anything answered!!!!!!
