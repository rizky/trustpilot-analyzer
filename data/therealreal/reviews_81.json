Last summer you lost an item I sent in to sell; my inquiries were ignored. Over the winter I bought 2 items which were not available due to an inventory error. January I requested that the money in my account be sent to me, didn\u2019t happen and, again, inquiries ignored. So basically I\u2019ll buy until I have no money left that you\u2019re holding and won\u2019t be sending anything else to sell. I\u2019ve been a nano second from contacting the BBB but now you have only $17 and I\u2019ll spend it eventually.

Then when chatting with your \u201ccustomer service\u201d I had to fight to get a full refund with the inclusion of the original shipping fee.  I have to wait minimum two weeks for a refund (not to count the transaction time from refund to credit card).  So I wasted so much of my precious time and have to wait so long for a refund.  You all should have the capital to take the time to take better pictures or at the very least write better description.

The coat sold fast naturally but when i complained twice I was offered nothing in the way of compensation except they were sorry i was unhappy.
