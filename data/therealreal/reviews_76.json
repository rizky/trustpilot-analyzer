I went with the more expensive version of the bag that I wanted because the description said it was in \u2018excellent\u2019, \u2018superb\u2019 condition. No visible problems. After receiving the bag, I was only able to carry it for less than one week when the strap broke off from the buckle attached to the purse. There is no way to carry the bag now. Upon further inspection, I see that the strap on the other side is also about to rip. It is an obvious problem that should have been noted and reported on their site to potential buyers. Now I am out a LOT of money and having to wait weeks or months for LV to fix the problem at who knows what the cost will be to make this a usable bag again. So disappointed.","title":"I was so excited about my LV purchase","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-04","author":"Kathleen Hiraga","text":"The Paul Smith jacket reeked of perfume and had spots that looked like food?

I got the glasses and was so disappointed. The scratch isn't even that noticeable, it is the fact that they were so grimy, dirty, and the company didn't even attempt to clean them up. In addition to that, one arm of the glasses is completely bent, and the Tory Burch logo is supposed to line up perfectly, but since it is bent, it looks distorted. This was my first purchase from the The RealReal and now I know to stay away. If I had this kind of a problem with a pair of sunglasses, who knows what I would run into if I was buying a luxury designer purse.","title":"I ordered a pair of Tory Burch\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-04","author":"Sevcoop","text":"My issue is with the shipping costs.  My item, a small phone case\/wallet, weighed 7.8 ounces, yet it cost me $12.95 for shipping.  The item itself cost $17.50.  As the item did not fit my phone - my mistake totally -  I returned it.  The RealReal wanted me to pay $11.95 for prepaid shipping, which would then result in the shipping costs being higher than the actual item itself.  Instead, I mailed it myself for $5.40.  While I knew the initial cost to ship it TO me, I was unaware of the cost associated with its return.  All in all, a very unsatisfactory transaction.","title":"Shipping Costs","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-04","author":"Ellen Williams","text":"Not only were the items not in a quality I would have sold them in but I never received my selling shipping label and for days I was being contacted about a pickup before I even got a label (still don\u2019t have) and then the rep ghosted me","title":"Terrible experience from start to finish","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-04","author":"customer","text":"I purchased a classic medium balenciaga motorcross bag and with having a few of my own purchased in store  I instantly noticed a huge difference when I received the bag I went to get it authenticated i received a call that the bag was in fact a fake I am extremely upset as this was my fear purchasing from this type of company now I\u2019ve spent $800 and this bag is final sale Im super upset.","title":"Was sold a Fake !","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-04","author":"Lina Kravitz","text":"terrible my glasses came in some weird case dirty as hell and with a lends cleaner that was also dirty so gross never again very disappointed","title":"terrible my glasses came in some weird\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-04","author":"Mickey Baker","text":"I was sent a free return label to return an item which you listed stating the wrong color.
