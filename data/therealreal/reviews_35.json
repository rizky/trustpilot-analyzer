[{"date":"2022-04-11","author":"customer","text":"I recently placed an order and while 3 out of 4 products came as described, one was not labeled properly. The website listed the shoe as a size 5 but did not specify women\u2019s or men\u2019s anywhere on the posting. It came up while searching for women\u2019s shoes, so I assumed it was a women\u2019s size 5. Because it is a sale item, it is final sale. So despite the fact it is the wrong size and was not labeled accordingly, I\u2019m out $200. I gave two stars due to the other products descriptions at least being accurate.","title":"Inaccurate Sizing\/Labeling","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=35&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-11","author":"Ala Bocharnikov","text":"The item was misrepresented by the company.

The first pair was great, but the second pair was ridiculously stained all along the lap. The stains were rust colored and obviously not part of the design or wash of the jeans. I was shocked as these certainly shouldn't have been approved for resale much less marked as \"Very Good\" condition. I went back and checked the image listing online and I could see tiny hints of the stains online, but just barely.\n\nReturning the jeans would cost me money, so I reached out to their customer service via text. The person helping me sent me an email with a shipping label and they said it would be a free return, but the email specifically said I'd be charged $12 for returning this item. The customer service rep said I wouldn't, but I didn't like feeling like I'd have to go off just their word. \n\nAll in all, this was a lot of extra work, resources, etc. for a product that had no business in resale at all.","title":"Received stained jeans that were NOT fit for resale.","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=35&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-11","author":"PER","text":"I felt that three pieces of clothing marked \u201cvery good\u201d condition were far from very good.

I don't think I'll do it again. From poor customer service, multiple items sent that were the wrong size, an obscure return policy on what's final sale (even if it's damaged or the wrong size), and a less than stellar tech experience with returns, it just isn't worth the hassle and the time I spent trying to get help sorting out problems. And you'll pay $12-13 for shipping, both to receive and to return. Beware that you won't get great help if you have a problem, it will be slow and you'll have to just \"stand by\" until they finally respond, and you might get stuck with items you can't return and nobody around to help you if the return is not your responsibility (e.g. the wrong size shipped in the first place).
