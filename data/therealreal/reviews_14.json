I sent in my brand new Cartier love bracelet in January. They mislabeled it as generic.  It took 4 months for them to confirm that it was Cartier, not generic. Then they took a picture of my bracelet where the shadow made my bracelet look damaged, so no one is buying it. They want to re-photograph the bracelet now, which will delay listing my bracelet for another month...bringing it to 6 months that I've waited. The RealReal is becoming sloppy and careless.  I could have been paid in one week from Fashionphile,  but I got greedy thinking I could make $100 more at TRR and it has been a fkg nightmare dealing with them.
