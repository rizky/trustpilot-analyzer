I understand that you guys are working at scale with huge quantities of merchandise, but dang, can we get some trustworthy measurements? I'm talking hip, thigh, leg opening, front rise, back rise, shoulder width, sleeve length, sleeve width. I used to work QC for an apparel company and I know that taking these measurements can be painstaking, but it would make it SO much easier to buy with confidence if I had more to go on than \"mid rise, straight leg, size small\" (which could apparently mean a wide variety of totally inequivalent sizes). And the photo quality! Black pants do not show up well when photographed against a white background with no close up details. I was SHOCKED to find that one of the pants I bought had a tuxedo stripe! Not only was it not visible in the pictures, it wasn't noted in the description! It would have been a pleasant surprise had the \"measurements\" been more accurate. Instead I have pants that don't fit that are not returnable due to the sale terms. NOT complaining about the price. Y'all keep doing those big sales. But if you're going to make deeply discounted merchandise non-returnable, at least let us know exactly what it is that we're buying. Feels like buying a mystery bag from a cheap fast fashion brand. (Will it fit? Will it look anything like the pictures? will it be made of the material it is listed as? Will it arrive looking like a garbage bag??) I get better descriptions, measurements, and pictures from sketchy eBay dealers than TRR. Unfortunately, I'm probably going to go back to buying secondhand designer direct from individuals since I can ask questions about the actual product and get actually helpful information.","title":"going back to eBay","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=7&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-04","author":"customer","text":"My bags arrived quickly. \nWas disappointed that I paid USD Prices when I clicked on the Canadian flag and signed in with my account.
