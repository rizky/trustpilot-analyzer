However, the shipping and duties in to Canada were astronomical. 3 of the items I purchased were made in California (so should be sent out duty free using the proper HS code) they weren't properly labelled for customs, so the duties were enormous. Since the responsibility of the HS code is on the shipper, I am stuck with a huge import fee. \nVery disappointed, and sadly, won't be shopping here again because of that.","title":"Great products, sadly shipping duties were outrageous.","stars":2,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=38&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-08","author":"customer","text":"I\u2019ve unsubscribed from emails so many times but they won\u2019t stop","title":"I\u2019ve unsubscribed from emails so many\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=38&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-08","author":"Suzanne Margolin","text":"I bought a Kate Space shoulder strap for my purse.

I packed 3 boxes of items for TheRealReal.  They gorilla market you via text to consign with them, so once I took the bait, they text me 3 or 4 times to ask how my packing was going.  I made a list of all my luxury items and packed them neatly. A driver came to take the three boxes and I received a receipt with the number of boxes.  They were a little bit nonchalant so I was worried but I figured it would be fine. Well was I wrong. I saw my items after 7 days in the app but only 1\/3 of them.  I asked where the rest of my items were and they said to wait. I did and I checked with customer service via chat and email almost every other day. The chat customer service is awful. It takes almost a full day for them to get back to you. It became clear after 2-3 weeks that they lost my items. Or stole them. Alexander McQueen items, Hermes, Halston, Thomas Wylde, Gucci, Tory Burch\u2026they launched an investigation and now they want pictures of everything.
