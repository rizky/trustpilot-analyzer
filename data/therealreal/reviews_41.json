But have had frustrations with the (overseas?) online customer service staff not adequately addressing my questions and problems.  On one occasion I spent over 30 minutes back and forth with the online agent, with LONG delays between messages, but ultimately my problem was not solved.  On another occasion I received an item with the inventory control tag attached. I was afraid to remove the tag myself without damaging the garment.  Since the nearest TRR store is 366 miles away, I was hoping they would send me a return shipping label to a TRR store\/warehouse where they could remove the tag, and mail the item back to me. No luck with that suggestion! It was recommended that i take the jacket to the \"nearest confectionery\" where they could remove the tag (?!)  Couldn't provide the specific names of any confectioneries near me.  And who in the US uses the term \"confectionery?\"","title":"Frustrations with customer service","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=41&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-06","author":"customer","text":"The size on the shoes I ordered was wrong. Listing said 9;5 and they were a 9.5 N.  Way too slim for my foot. No phone number included with packing slip. No phone number found on website.  I wanted to speak to rep so as not to pay shipping charges to return and went through a 2 hr total texting ordeal waiting and misunderstanding throughout the process of the robotic texts and human texts.  Decided to sell shoes in my store to avoid wasting more time. Also had a customer service rep from TheRealReal give out my personal cell phone number to one of your consignors living in NJ.  When she called she thought I was a rep from TheRealReal. Not sure how this happened but the credibility of the company definitely came in to question. I called the Atlanta store to voice my concern and they basically said there was nothing they could do.","title":"The size on the shoes I ordered was\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=41&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-06","author":"Donna Myers","text":"The Bag is not what I was looking for, which happens.
