So I wanted to know and check the size of the bag. Customer service said what they have on the description is correct and every bag has different dimensions. So I believed what she said and purchased the bag; however, when I received the back and it felt much bigger than I thought. So I did measure the dimensions and the height of the bag was 8.25\" instead of 6.25\". I started a conversation to make a return and the customer service representative was able to help me to start the return. They said they will have to re-authenticate the bag so it will take 7-10 business days to get my money back. It's kinda annoying that I have to wait that long to get my money back. If they had a correct information, I wouldn't have bought it.","title":"incorrect item description","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=54&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-25","author":"Heba rida","text":"Bad condition the leather is so bad 200 in the garbage","title":"Bad condition the leather is so bad 200\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=54&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-25","author":"Gary Mann","text":"Sent back last Friday.

One with the main zipper torn away on bottom side (bag can't close) the other the carry strap was chewed on (presumably by a pet) to the point it won't have held a load. The more disturbing part was both time attempts were made to hide the damage in the photos and even strategically setting up the bags to hide it on initial inspection. Which leads me to question are they actually inspecting the items or are they the ones being very dishonest.","title":"Deceptive condition on bags","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=54&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-26","author":"customer TJ","text":"I purchased Tory Burch purse and wrist wallet.
