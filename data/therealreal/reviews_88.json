It didn\u2019t get tugged or caught on anything, just broke as I was unhooking it. Such a bummer because it was a lot of money & I never spend this much on myself. Might not be any one\u2019s fault, just wish the quality of the piece had factored into the price more. Still want to keep it, will just have to pay to find a nicer chain to put it on :\/","title":"Beautiful piece but broke immediately:(","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-17","author":"customer","text":"Quality is good but size is not matching on the your website.","title":"Quality is good but size is not\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-17","author":"customer","text":"The bag didn\u2019t match the pictures, it said authenticity cart and it came blanc, it was not fill with purchase date or store.","title":"The bag didn\u2019t match the pictures","stars":3,"location":"CO","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-18","author":"customer","text":"Very short return window.

Also received very quick.  However, too big of a pen mark on outside of purse and lining inside looked like either bleach or maybe a wad of gum was stuck inside and lining was very discolored.  To me looked like dried gum that was pulled out of the bag and this grossed me out.  I was able to return it with no problem.  Not sure what qualifies this very good rating.

They didn\u2019t even rubber band the box shut, so I\u2019m sure it just slammed around inside the shipping box. Luckily the bag itself was well wrapped and was not damaged.
