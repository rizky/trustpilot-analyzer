I was not able to be home when they delivered and it was pouring rain. Luckily, I was able to find a friend to bring the package inside for me. When I opened the package, the items were wrapped in a thin fabric cover. I had a $200 leather handbag that would have been DESTROYED had it been left outside any longer. They should not only require signatures for their packages since they're dealing with high end, expensive items, but they should also be packaged better to withstand any elements they might encounter. \n\nAdditionally, they need to have more photos of their handbags online. I was surprised that there was a thick mesh shoulder strap on the bag I ordered. This was not in the description or in any of the photos.","title":"Terrible Shipping Practices","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=9&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-02","author":"customer","text":"I got the wrong brand.

I was told that it would be impossible to cancel my order on   the same day as my purchase, this is not my first time buying from you; it was possible to cancel before. I respected the new rules, and I paid the import fee to receive the merchandise to start returning it. It did not come with the return label inside the box n the receipt. I began the process on The Real Real app, and I received an email telling me that I could print the return label, but the link was broken, and it did not open, only redirected me to the Canada unit. When I complained about asking for help, I I felt ignored, and the sensation was that you were forcing me to stay with an item that didn't fit me and asking me. To wait for a week or so to have someone to assist me. I'm a customer of yours, and I would like to have the attention that I'm sure I deserve. I might have bought little things but I have been loyal and I always recommend your store to my friends. The dress doesn't fit me but the pants is amazing.
