When I started to place my order the dress was offered at one price and during the procedure it changed\u2026very confusing, for me as well as the representative. When I did receive the dress it was impossible to try on because the TRR tag was attached to the side and through the sleeve so I couldn\u2019t get my arm through the sleeve without taking the tag off and thus risking not being able to return the dress. I chose to return. My first and only time, too much hassle and stress for me.

However, the book I ordered was not in pristine condition. When it arrived, I opened the book and the seam not glued to the pages and I had to re-gule the seam myself in order to actually flip through the book, if not the pages would just tear off. I could've returned it but decided not too and fixed the issue myself because everything else was in perfect condition. Not sure if the glue melted during shipping or the description was inaccurate, that's why I give 3 stars.","title":"First time buyer, experience was ok..","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-30","author":"customer","text":"The condition of the handbag was way overstated. The fact that they are final sale makes me very hesitant to trust the information provided, especially for items that are worth thousands of dollars. In addition to a lot of visible scratches on the leather, the bag has an incredibly strong odor that was obviously not easily known unless it was disclosed. It also seemed like the photos were intentionally taken in a way to hide the visible wear. \nI would not be upset with the purchase if the condition of the handbag was more transparently shared or if there was a way to process returns based on the fact that the description of the condition vs. the reality did not match.","title":"Condition vs. Reality did not match","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-30","author":"Louis nwokeocha","text":"You guys are using text to answer customer problem and you guys are so so so bad with it.texting and snswering with wrong answers.all that do is to frustrate customers like me.scrap it its nonsense.","title":"You guys are using text to answer\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-30","author":"Rosemary B","text":"I\u2019m sorry to report that in my first experience with RealReal that I did not receive the pretty earrings I purchased. RealReal advertises they use UPS as their delivery service.  But for my order, their carrier UPS subbed out the local delivery to the US postal service.  UPS and RealReal reported to me that my jewelry was delivered into my mailbox!  (Not to my doorstep!!). And it was not there!  UPS directed me to USPS.  USPS will take two weeks to research.  Real real refunded me but all I wanted was my jewelry.  Three hours of my life wasted on calls hassles claims.  Real real service efficient but did not deliver the product. \n\nI encourage real real to RETHINK your delivery carrier choices!
