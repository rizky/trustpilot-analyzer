The first time I put them on and walked two step across the carpeted floor, the heel popped right off. I took both shoes to a cobbler to put zip soles on and repair the one heel and they showed me that the second shoe also lacked proper adhesive. So I spent another $80 to repair both shoes before adding zip soles that were NWT. I love the style, but would expect a very different product quality from NWT on the RealReal.","title":"NWT, but soles fell apart on first few steps on carpet","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=36&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-10","author":"Kimberly","text":"I bought shoes that were described as being in \"good\" condition.  They were in not in good condition at all.  I would rate as them as poor to fair.  Stained, heels and toes worn through and very stiff, felt like they were very old and starting to disintegrate.  Even though these shoes are overpriced when they sell new for $398, $115 for these is no deal.  I returned them but did not think I should have to pay for return shipping on something that was not accurately described and the damage was not disclosed or shown in the pictures.  There should also be a comments box attached to the reason for return.

Often the garments are photographed incorrectly (a skirt as a tube dress, for example) or described incorrectly. The pricing is also all over the place, sometimes a brand new pair of shoes will be $100, but then you will see the same pair of shoes, in worse condition, for 2x the price.
