I compared it to the one I recently bought directly from the Beverly Hills Gucci store (both bags from the same Supreme mini bag collection, slightly different model, same structure). I knew as soon as I felt it taking it out of the bag. Terrible packaging for \"luxury\" items. That should have been my first sign. And zero acknowledgement on any of the papers that the Controllato card was missing. I don't need the card per se, but I needed to know that TRR's Authentication team understood how important that missing piece would be to paying over 1k for a preowned Gucci bag from 2020.","title":"I was sold a fake Gucci bag","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=93&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-11","author":"Customer","text":"Horrible customer service.

Horrible customer service after spending so much money on something that was suppose to be so special. Valentine\u2019s Day & dinner are now ruined.
