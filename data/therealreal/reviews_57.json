I have been waiting weeks and weeks regarding jewelry pieces and other clothing to see what is being accepted and what isn\u2019t.

It was to be a gift. The condition was listed as \"very good,\" which I know isn't excellent, but I thought it would be in very good condition. However, when it arrived, although it looked pretty good, it reeked of cigarette smoke. Not appropriate at all as a gift. Terribly disappointed, I went to your site to see how to return or exchange, but this item was listed as \"not returnable.\" I had not noticed anything to that effect when I purchased, so this has left a bitter taste in my mouth.

The import fees are pretty big, on a pair of gucci shoes I paid \u00a3317 for, I had to pay \u00a3155 on fees and VAT. I paid \u00a396 fees on a skirt I paid \u00a3466 on so unless you understand fees pretty well, you might be surprised.\n\n2. Going forward I would only ever buy new or pristine items. I bought suede gucci shoes marked as condition very good. Notes were light scuffs on soles. I wish I could add pics here but the heels were so scuffed there is no suede left on them. Getting a returns label is easy but knowing how to get your vat\/customs fees back seems so difficult. So just because they say light scuffs (and the pics are taken so you can't really see the damage) doesn't mean that is what is going to turn up.\n\nI have bought a lot of stuff from therealreal and this is the first time I am disappointed but now at least I have learned not to risk buying their used items.
