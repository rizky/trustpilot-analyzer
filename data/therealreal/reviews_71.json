I have purchased several items and have sold items too.  But the purchase I made recently was very disappointing.  Arriving today was a cute Burberry blazer and a Piazza Simone top.  The top was ok, very high in the underarms but at 75% off it's ok. The blazer on the other hand, also 75% off, was given a \"good\" rating but failed to mention marks on the sleeve and yellowing at the cuffs of the sleeve and neck area.  Unfortunately it's a final sale.   I would not have purchased the blazer, even at the very discounted price, if I had known of the issues.  I will take it to a dry cleaners and see if it will help, but overall I was very disappointed.","title":"Quality control took a day off","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=71&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-09","author":"customer","text":"My e-mail is blowing up with offers i am not interested in!!!!!!!!!!!!!","title":"My e-mail is blowing up with offers i\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=71&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-09","author":"customer","text":"Photo quality doesn\u2019t depict true flaws of the item purchased. \n\nStain on bag is significantly darker and more noticeable in person than in the photos. \n\nIf it was a returnable item, I\u2019d definitely send it back.","title":"Photo quality doesn\u2019t depict true flaws\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=71&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-09","author":"customer","text":"I ordered a lot of stuff and everything was in super bad condition.
