I wrote to TRR about that and they issued me a credit for $11 on an item that was over $100 but that never showed up in my account as a credit. \nSecond disappointment is a  purchase received of a blouse that was listed as FRAME but was, in fact, a Vince blouse and the label was plain to see in the neckline. I will now be charged the $11.95 shipping label fee to return that blouse for an error that was clearly not mine. In that shipment was also another blouse which I will have to re-consign and even though I am shipping them back to TRR together, I am charged for two shipping labels at $11:95 each. My advice would be to never buy anything on final sale, which stupidly I did, because I have another blouse now that I cannot use. \n\nOther than those purchases, I\u2019m happy with TRR.","title":"Twice disappointmented:-\/","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=19&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"customer","text":"really upset with the packaging of my order.
