To ship them back would have been $11.95 in addition to the $12.95 to have them shipped. Shoes were as described other than the smaller than normal size for that brand. I\u2019ll look elsewhere because of the very high shipping costs.

It took multiple inquiries for them to sort out a) where it was coming from b) how long it would take and when it did come, it came in a box that could've probably fit 50 golf clubs (I bought one). Shipping was half the cost of the total (about $40). It wasn't even securely wrapped - one piece of tape was keeping it together by a thread. If the box, while poorly sized, wasn't so sturdy, this item would've never survived.\n\nThey have a good idea, they have a pretty smooth platform as far as their customer service, but it seems like they haven't really thought out each step of the way.

However, when I received the wallet there was visible discoloration (faint yellow stain on white wallet). \n\nI contacted customer service and sent in a photo. They were only willing to either have me send the wallet back for a full refund, or if I kept the wallet they could only provide a small credit towards the website or refund me for shipping.. \n\nI really wanted to keep the wallet because it's unique but disappointed with my options.
