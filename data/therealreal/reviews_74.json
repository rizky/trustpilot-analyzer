Obviously, it was my choice to look for a used\/worn but good version of the LongChamp Le Pliage tote. I was on the market for a budget-friendly purchase from a trusted source. I've seen mixed reviews about The Real Real and wanted to give it a try myself. I should have known better.\n\nI found a tote within my budget and appeared to be well taken care of for a used tote bag. It was everything I had wanted for the price tag. I felt a bit disappointed after completing my order because I realized the total cost would bring me close to a brand new tote. But again, I decided to follow through.\n\nWhen my tote arrived, it was well packaged and in a dust bag. The bag appeared as the photos except for trash inside the bag. There was a tattered gum packet inside the bag and let's just face it, I was disgusted. Where is quality assurance? It made me check other reviews of mishaps and also made me question whether or not it's an authentic bag.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't think I would purchase again. I don't want a hit and miss product. I feel that there still needs to be improvements in order for me to ever decide to make another purchase.","title":"Still not sure how I feel about luxury\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=74&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-06","author":"customer","text":"The shoes that I purchased where two sizes too small than what the site said.","title":"wrong size shoe","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=74&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-06","author":"JenK","text":"I wish the description of shoes indicated if the sizes are for Men, Women or both, or international size especially Adidas and what would be the exact size in inch.

First of all, I was unable to use the $25 coupon I had received via email. I kept getting a message that made no sense.\nSo I decided to shop without it as I had already chosen some items. \nThe box with the items arrived within a reasonable period of time, however it was packed somewhat carelessly. Out of 4 items I wanted to return one that did not fit. I signed into the website and under \"my orders\" I was not given a choice to mark the item I wanted to return. Again, it is my first time shopping here so maybe I am the one who is missing information.  The skirt that I want to return is too small on me, plus one of the belt loops is loose, needs to be sawn in place. That's how I received it.

The pants I purchased were listed in my XS search but they are not true XS Patagonia pants. Patagonia uses the number system for sizing on some items and the letter system for sizing on others. I should have read the description more closely because it did say XS\/2, but you should list items based on what is actually on the tag to be consistent with how manufacturers label their clothing. I would have never purchased size 2 Patagonia pants because I know they don\u2019t fit me. But I trusted what was listed in my search for XS bottoms. The pants were also listed as \u201cvery good\u201d condition. The butt has a number of pulls and missing thread around the pockets.
