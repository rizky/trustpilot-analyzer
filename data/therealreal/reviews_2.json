I decided to splurge on a few pieces that I could use for my new job. I ordered three items-- a full grey suit, a black skirt, and a green blouse.\n\nGrey Suit: The suit jacket was perfect BUT the matching skirt had holes in it (along the back seam of the skirt). No where in the listing were holes mentioned, in fact, the description made it sound like the suit was practically brand new. Obviously it would have been helpful to know that the item had holes in it. (Had I known, I would have gone with something else.) \n\nBlack Skirt: The black skirt was also a bit of a let down. The skirt turned out to have two layers (this was not mentioned in the listing)--an outer layer and a inner layer. The outer layer is a tweed wool material, and the inner layer is a silky material. The measurements provided on the listing were for the OUTER layer-- not the INNER layer. (The inner layer is about two inches smaller than the outer layer.) Long story short, the skirt does not fit. I am disappointed. Again, had I known, I would have gone with something else. \n\nGreen Blouse was perfect. I was 100% satisfied with the blouse. \n\nOverall, don't expect to get something that you will be able to wear right out of the box. The items may be measured incorrectly (or maybe it would be more accurate to say incompletely), and contain surprise damage like holes.","title":"Hit or Miss","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=2&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-08","author":"Jemma","text":"There was a major defect in the bag I purchased that wasn\u2019t disclosed in the photos or in the description.
