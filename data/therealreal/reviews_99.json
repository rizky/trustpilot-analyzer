They use UPS which are absolutely hopeless. I have a disability so when I know a package is coming I sit down stairs in the lounge which is next to the front door. \n7pm at night I finally have in and assumed it wasn\u2019t being delivered that day refreshes the delivery website and it said delivered. I went outside and looked everywhere and nothing. No one had knocked and I hadn\u2019t signed for anything. I rang UPS (don\u2019t use them terrible customer service) they couldn\u2019t have cared less they said it was showing as delivered and I asked how it has to be signed for they said the driver signs now because of covid. So the package has either been delivered to the wrong address or the drivers can see where these packages are coming from sign for them and keep them. \nSo o contacted the real real they weren\u2019t Interested and kept sending me emails saying it says delivered and signed for I said I hadn\u2019t signed for anything and they didn\u2019t care in the slightest.
