The Real Real sent me the wrong item. When I tried to return it, the customer service rep makes you jump through so many hoops and answer so many questions- it was super inconvenient and not easy at all. You have to prove that an item they sent you is wrong by taking pictures and uploading them to the site chat.  The website pictures of what you think you're buying don't actually match the item they send you (this happened twice). Also they will charge you a 12$ Return service charge for luxury item, even when the item description doesn't match the website description or the item they send is wrong. For a luxury service\/retail store, it has not been a good experience for the 3 items I bought and then subsequently returned all 3.","title":"Customer service took forever  and the\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=67&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-13","author":"customer","text":"I received the bag and it was covered with something that was orange and felt like sand.
