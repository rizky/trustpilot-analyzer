Couldn\u2019t tell me country of origin\u2026\nBought the bag anyway hoping for the best as it looked in pretty good condition. Again what a mess. Never got a shipping email and then I go to check my account about 4 or 5 days later because I was curious and it had already shipped and was due to arrive in a day or 2.\nUSPS leaves it in a puddle never rings the bell and when I see it has arrived I go get it box is SMASHED\u2026 and even better the bag only has a dust bag no wrapping or protection of any kind. Heck it wasn\u2019t even stuffed so it got banged around and was flat as a pancake. What a horrible experience. I open it to make sure it\u2019s not wet and it\u2019s way dirtier than the picture and the inside smells like a grandma spilled her whole bottle of cheap perfume in it. I was so upset I cried put it in a corner and can\u2019t even look at it I\u2019m so mad and upset. Feels like a bag I was so excited for is tainted by such a garbage experience. I would never shop here again.\n\n***edit I called therealreal and they have let me return it free shipping because of my bad experience which I am very grateful for","title":"Returning\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=31&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-14","author":"Customer","text":"The fact that there is a high shipping cost AND a ridiculous and high return cost is unnecessary. Other thrift websites like ThredUp don't have expenses this high and even offer free shipping when you spend a certain amount and offer ways to waive the very low return fee. Given how much more money your items sell for, it's definitely unnecessary.\n\nI want to do better for the planet and thrift, but when you're selling used products you need to make it more worthwhile compared to going to buy them new.","title":"More Money Than It's Worth.","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=31&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-14","author":"customer","text":"Good service, wish shipping was free and there needs to be more images of the product","title":"Good service","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=31&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-15","author":"Juanita Patton","text":"I purchased a pair of Chanel red patent leather shoes that were listed as 8-1\/2. When they arrived (4\/6\/2022), they were size 6-1\/2. I returned them the same day via a label provided by trr. They were received by trr (4\/8\/2022) that Friday and confirmed via email that day and another of the same on 4\/11\/2022. I was told by your outsourced team, that because it\u2019s an Chanel purchase, it would have to be authenticated which would be up to 14 days before I would receive credit back to my method of payment. I asked if I could speak with a supervisor (not her fault) in the USA, I was told they could not transfer, but that they would send a text for someone to call. That never happened. It\u2019s only after I went to social media did I get my refund. I sent back another Chanel purchase due to this frustrating debacle and vowed to never do business with trr again.","title":"I purchased a pair of Chanel red patent\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=31&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-15","author":"LOU","text":"The Burberry bag did not disclosed that one of the snaps was broken.
