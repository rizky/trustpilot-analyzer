It ends there. Customer service and administration and review\/oversight of products is horrendous. Corrections are NEVER made to erroneous postings (completely incorrect sizes reposted for sale with no correction after returns and in two cases for me completely incorrect item posted) causing other customers to keep purchasing the same incorrect item over and over again, forcing the person who initially consigned the item to get a price on a heavily discounted item because no one will buy it and it can\u2019t sell. This hasn\u2019t happened just once. It happens in no less than 30-40% of my transactions. And there is Never an apology for the repeated inconvenience let alone an offer for a discount or discounted shipping for the aggrieved customer by customer service.
