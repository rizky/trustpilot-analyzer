It has become my go-to shop for high quality basics, and their selection is amazing. One recurring issue I've noticed though is inconsistency with listing the condition of the item. Sometimes big stains will not be listed, and may be tough to see in the photos. Colours of garments can also be listed incorrectly, such as an 'orange' garment listed as 'red'. Other times damage will not be listed at all (such as broken buttons or burns from an iron). Most stains come out with a gentle wash and stain remover, but other damage can't be repaired. I would just advise other shoppers to have an eagle eye when looking at an item, and be prepared to invest a little time or money into it.","title":"Great Selection but Inconsistent Listings","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=55&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-24","author":"customer","text":"I bought a shirt that was advertised as a mens shirt and when it arrived it was a womans shirt.

On the day it was supposed to arrive I tracked my item and it said that it was being returned to the sender, as the sender had requested so. I talked to over 5 customer representatives and each said something different, no one could tell me what had happened with my package and why the sender requested that my bag was sent back. No one tried to do anything to make my experience a bit better. On top of that, had an agent who lied and said I was getting my bag until one specific day for sure just have another agent tell me that wasn\u2019t happening one day later. So, very bad experience, no one is remotely worried about the customer experience or solving problems that come up during the order.","title":"Bought my bag more than 2 weeks ago","stars":1,"location":"PE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=55&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-24","author":"customer","text":"There was no indication at checkout or my confirmation email that the clothing I purchased was final sell.
