But the shoes I received were most definitely not size 8 - they\u2019re at least two sizes smaller.  \n\nI emailed customer service for guidance on my options for return\/refund, since I did not get the item I believed I was paying for.  \n\nI got an email back, probably from a bot, that said I would not be getting any kind of refund because the shoes were listed as \u201cfinal sale\u201d. \nI wrote back and said this reply is unacceptable since the purchase I made was for a Size 8 shoe - it was posted for sale as such and the expectation is that I would receive the Size 8 shoe.   I did not receive the Size 8 - the shoes are unusable.  \n\nThe only fair and reasonable action would be to allow me to return the shoes, at TRR\u2019s expense, and either refund my payment money, or give me store credit.  \n\nI have not heard back from TRR, which tells me they don\u2019t care, and essentially did a bait and switch.
