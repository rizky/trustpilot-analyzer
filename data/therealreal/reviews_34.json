They looked disheveled, faded and worn just like what you get in garage sales. I bought three large-sized Polo t-shirts and what arrived were sized-large shirts that were actually 2XL in other stores. Without trying them on, I returned the items and was aghast with their refund. Out of the $72.95 that I paid for those shirts they only refunded $48.05 deducting return shipping and promo cost. This company is making profits thru the return of their thrashy products.\n\nTip for consumers:\nBeware, products looked worn and clothes' sizes are way larger than normal while deductions on refunds are exorbitant you feel robbed!","title":"Clothes in RealReal are nothing to be proud of to be\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=34&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-12","author":"customer","text":"I'm disappointed that the Dior sunglasses I purchased were described as \"Excellent\" but they arrived with non-symmetrical temple arms. They were so uneven and crooked on my face it should have been obvious to whoever inspected them that these were not in excellent shape. They should have said, these will need adjustment in the item description. Customer service was helpful and I went through with a return on the item. I would love to have kept them and gotten them fixed somewhere but the way these are designed there is no guarantee they can even do it. Also, with the very short timeframe to make a return I felt I had no choice as I don't want to be stuck with potentially broken sunglasses if they can't fix them. I will also add, the item was packaged very well and not smashed or anything. These glasses were sent to me this way from The Real Real.","title":"I'm disappointed that the Dior\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=34&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-12","author":"Arsineh Aghakhani","text":"The glasses arrived with the side piece loose and it slides back and forth on the side of the glasses.

This was quite disappointing as I paid over $900 and was under the impression that such a rigorous authentication process (as advertised) would never have allowed this. The purse I purchased could have been bought on the streets for $50. I\u2019m thankful that I was given a full refund, but needless to say, I do not consider The Real Real a trusted source to make future purchases. I also had a very frustrating time dealing with texts\/emails\/communication with customer service. All of the texts from The Real Real were coming to my son and my husband as well. I had difficulty getting in touch with a real person and the virtual service was of little help too.

Easy-to-use website.  \nWould not say the product was 100% \"pristine\". There were minor, faint scrapes at back of each shoe and one side of the right shoe front looked slightly \"pulled\", as if the shoe had been stretched, where the top of the shoe meets the sole. The Gucci shoe box was damaged and one of the shoe bags had what seemed to be a lipstick stain on it - weird as these are men\u2019s shoes.\nFor future consideration, Luisaviaroma website includes local tax & duties in their pricing which is why I often order from them. RR should try to do the same so that there is less of a guessing game for clients ordering from outside the US.  Personally, incurred an additional cost of $200+ in duty and taxes. I could almost have purchased a truly new and pristine pair directly from Gucci for close to the same total cost incurred for these loafers.","title":"Good and less good.","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=34&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-12","author":"customer","text":"I spent almost $1500 the earrings for my wife\u2019s birthday.
