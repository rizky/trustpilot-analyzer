That said, online businesses should minimize the barrier to entry by offering things like free shipping. I placed an order that I thought would fit and of course none of the items did. I tried calling the store but they can't offer free shipping unless you spend $1,000 which is astronomically high. That said, this experience is a reminder to not buy on the RealReal because I end up wasting money.

I had specifically made sure to buy on here because I had heard nothing but good things about this website, so I thought I could trust that everything was authentic. Well when I received the bag I was shocked at how fake the bag was and how it passed their \u201cauthenticity\u201d process! The bag was obviously fake leather, the gold was fake and tarnished, the inside was a cheap cloth lining, and so many more red flags were found in less then 5 minutes after I opened my package. I was so mad and hurt that I couldn\u2019t trust this website after all. I will never recommend this site to anyone and am utterly disappointed. The only reason why I would even rate it one star is for the fact that I received my money back and was able to ship it back for free as well.
