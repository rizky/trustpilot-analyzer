The order sent to me was the wrong item, brand, color. It was so unfortunate because it was due to arrive before an event I wanted to use it for. Customer service has not been helpful.

Surprised and deflated as I had paid $700+ for the pair. Took a few tries to get ahold of their customer service via text and their response was to say that their pricing is structured through their marketing team. Regardless the entire experience was unorganized and made me wary of how they price their items. Terrible customer service system as I couldn\u2019t speak to anyone who had a satisfactory explanation for why this shipment even got fulfilled with a price tag attached that doesn\u2019t match the charge. If anything, the experience of purchasing something special and luxurious was robbed as I unpacked that box.
