[{"date":"2022-04-29","author":"SS","text":"I used to shop the RealReal constantly, I\u2019m one of those who \u201cinvests\u201d in retail as therapy & constantly look for unique pieces. AKA shopaholic.  Found many great pieces over the years but quality has tanked. \n\n RR was the only \u201cre-sale\u201d venue I use\/ used, I\u2019ll likely stick to Sak\u2019s\/ Nordstrom, etc. moving forward.  \nThe last two purchases have been (1) a disaster and the second, extremely disappointing.\n\n1: Roland Mouret dress, arrived with an obviously broken zipper, half back zip - dress hanging open with the zipper hanging 1\/2 way down & missing the top counterpart.  The label was attached via a safety pin, it could have been attached to any dress (so much for authenticity).  Neither was noted under \u2018condition\u2019, it was listed as \u201cvery good\u201d.  Customer service was shockingly rude & unhelpful, especially given the literal  thousands I\u2019ve spent at RR.  They didn\u2019t even offer to pay for shipping to send it back.  \nA year 1\/2 later I decided to give them another try.  One of the shirts purchased, listed as \u201cvery good\u201d, looked so used my sister said it should be donated when we were purging my closet.  Pilled & the color was super faded.  Another dress had armpit stains,...  it\u2019s not a deal if you can\u2019t used the clothes you buy.  \nIf you decide to purchase from RR, I suggest New With Tags, Only (although, back in the day I was burned once with a NWT purchase as well).  \nI doubt I\u2019ll be using RR for retail much if at all in the future.","title":"Disappointing & on occasion, outright theft\/  false advertising to the extreme","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/therealreal.com?page=13&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-29","author":"Kate Spade \u2660\ufe0f fan","text":"I bought a dress.

I knew it was pre-owned and I knew it was graded as only \"good\" but the description failed to mention that the inner lining was completely torn. Had I known that I would've chosen a different bag. Now I question the accuracy of the description on the website. It's one thing to miss a minor scratch but a completely torn inner lining cannot be missed. Whether it was left out intentionally would be arguable, to say the least.
