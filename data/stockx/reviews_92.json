Bought a pair of Jordan 1 Sea Foams for my wife.. I screwed up and got the wrong size.   I just turned around and resold them on StockX\u2026 never even out of the box. They sold quickly however they didn\u2019t pass inspection when I sold them!!!??? When I asked why StockX rep was a complete ass\u2026 basically sidestepped my issue and said I shouldn\u2019t have accepted them when I bought them.

The buying process went smoothly and they arrived quickly.  However, I paid full price and they were guaranteed New, 100% authentic Nike shoes.  When they arrived and were opened, they were obviously not new, creased, and stitching on both shoes actually coming loose in a few spots.  I would advise anyone to take precautions when ordering, consider other option,  and if this is their experience, to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.","title":"I was excited to purchase these shoes\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=92&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-28","author":"Daniel","text":"My prizm hanger box only had 19 of the 20 cards","title":"My prizm hanger box only had 19 of the\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=92&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-28","author":"andree","text":"Website indicated price in Canadian dollars but final\nBill was way high because of American currency\nVery misleading","title":"Website indicated price in Canadian\u2026","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=92&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-28","author":"jzzybb","text":"i have ordered through stockX before and the shoes were absolutely perfect but my last purchase i was not happy with. the shoes look like someone used white out on then and their was little stains all over the all white shoe, even though i bought them as deadstock.","title":"i have ordered through stockX before\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=92&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-28","author":"Annette","text":"Bought a pr of sneakers n wasn't sure if the purchase went through soooo I did it again,  not knowing that an EMAIL was sent acknowledging my purchase.
