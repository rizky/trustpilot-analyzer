Ordered Nike Challenger OGs (fortunately just after everyday trainers) but the white tick had a yellow discolouration. No idea how this passed 'quality control' or if just simply shines a light on how bad a check they actually do or they actually have low standards. I wouldn't wear these and if tried to sell on eBay or elsewhere any buyer would no doubt, rightfully, complain. StockX thought free shipping on my next purchase. Firstly this c\u00a315 offer is nowhere near sufficient, and secondly wrongly assumes that I will ever use StockX again. Unfortunately I recently ordered Patent Bred's so again at the mercy of StockX's so-called quality control. Wish I hadn't now. \n\nIf you are buying from StockX to guarantee you receive authentic and 'new' condition trainers then please manage your expectations as whilst I'm sure most are absolutely fine, for me personally I don't intend on taking another risk.\n\nUPDATE FOLLOWING RESPONSE - your own FAQs cite 5 years as when a customer should expect some level of aging, however these were released June 2020 - so not even 2 years old. Surely that should have been indication that they are either not authentic to show aging so soon or that the seller is selling damaged items that cant be classed as like new' as the product description listed on your website used to entice a purchase includes.\n\nStockX is clearly a site for protecting seller's and not purchases as the 'authentication stage' clearly isnt fit for purpose and from my own experience, and evidently based on other reviews, neither is the customer service department.","title":"Bad quality 'quality testing'","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"John","text":"Was $50 more than the price after fees and took over a week longer than expected to deliver.","title":"Was $50 more than the price after fees\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=23&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"Michelle Evans","text":"Horrible Horrible service.
