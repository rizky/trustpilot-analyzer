So far, I'm dissatisfied with the speed of not only the product delivery but the status updates. I'm admittedly new to StockX and was unaware of the process to recieve the shoes. Still, I order many shoes from many sites and these have taken the longest, by far. \nThe order itself was accidental and there was no cancel information readily available. There should be a grave period to change my mind. That's a major negative. Nike\/SNKRS are excellent in that aspect of customer service. I wanted the shoes, however, so I've waited for the order to be carried out. After 2 weeks I'm still waiting for the shoes to be recieved by StockX. That leaves me with no clear indication of when the shoes will get to me. Yet the money was deducted instantly. If this is how purchases are generally handled, the chances of me patronizing StockX in the future are slim. There are far too many other sneaker sources.","title":"Still waiting...","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=51&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-05","author":"Shay","text":"My package has not arrived and i don't have any tracking information available when in select tracking because the sender isn\u2019t reachable.","title":"My package has not arrived and i don't\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=51&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-05","author":"Kelly","text":"I want to return the shoes they\u2019re too big","title":"I want to return the shoes they\u2019re too\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=51&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-05","author":"Oliver Alessio Roberti","text":"Expensive to buy and sell.
