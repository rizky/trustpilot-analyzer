Knowing StockX no return policy I had absolutely no problem with this. However Stockx of course does offer their platform to sell it back via them to another buyer. Now I kept the jacket in the box in its original packaging and never took it out after my first glance at the jacket when I received it. So I sold the jacket via stockx the exact same state I received it even incouding the stockx tag! Now I get the jacket sent back saying the materials were \u2018inconsistent\u201d They charged me 15 dollars for this and when I asked them why it was ok for them to sell it to me but not for me to sell it again via them and they didnt reply anymore and are now playing games with my account and not allowing me to buy any other products anymore from their platform. This is horrible service and I hope there will be another provider soon with a similar catalogue for resale goods.","title":"Once bought a jacket from stockx and\u2026","stars":1,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=59&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-31","author":"Bella","text":"I will never order from this site again. I usually order from Flightclub as my boys are sneaker heads. In error I ordered from StockX HUGE MISTAKE . It has been a month and no order. They say seller has 2 days to ship to stockX to be verified weeks later nothing . Then I received an email saying they ran into trouble but got a new seller . Why not give me the option as it had been weeks. OK then I got a tracking number but it was odd because it never showed the seller shipped it to StockX . Then I received an email 2 days ago saying my order was delivered!!!!! This Never happened. I have several emails throughout this entire order all everyone would say is Im sorry and offered 20$ off next order. Who would ever order from them again. We pay higher than retail as it is a 3rd party but to then also have me charged for an item that a month later is still not here!!!! I want my money back now!!!!!!!","title":"I will never order from this site\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=59&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-31","author":"John","text":"Shoe didn't fit.
