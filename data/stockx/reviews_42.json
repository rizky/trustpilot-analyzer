It kept trying to take me to the app before I was finished ordering. As a result I accidentally ended up ordering two pair of shoes....both at over $300...unfortunately stockxxx doesn't offer refunds even though I discovered the problem almost immediately after it had occurred. \nLuckily however, because of the two-step authentication process, one of the pairs of shoes was found to not be authentic at which point the company sent the shoes back to the seller and issued me a full refund. I was very relieved because I needed that money. But if I ever order from stockx again, I will be using a prepaid card with only the correct amount needed for the item being purchased.","title":"The ordering process was tricky and\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=42&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
