Took them into a Nike store and compared with a brand new TN in different colour. I was not wrong, and Nike employee agreed. \nSeems someone owned these for a while n just walked around their house in them, as bottom of shoes came covered in carpet and dog hair, dog hair in shoe as well. \nUnfortunately only thing I can prove with photos is the scuffing and different shoe laces, and how is it worth my time sending the shoes back over this, the shoes are still in \u201cnew\u201d LOOKING condition, the rebound and cushion of the sole is very worn out, obviously someone\u2019s house shoes for a while before they decided to resell them through stock X, would of been happy to pay for the shoes at a much lower price if they were listed as \u201cused but new condition\u201d \nso what\u2019s the point in me sending them back and being left without shoes? When the only thing I can prove and u will accept is the shoe laces r different and the obvious scuff marks.\nHow these shoes got past a stock X \u201ccheck\u201d and sold as \u201cbrand new\u201d is laughable, you don\u2019t check the cushion quality to check for ware? the dog hair? The scuff marks? one of the shoe laces is not even long enough to tie up! \n\nabsolutely disgusted Stock X took money from me for \u201cbrand new\u201d shoes, considering the dog hair and scuff marks and different length shoe laces alone, not to mention the actual worse part, the shoes feel like they have been worn in by someone who weighs 300 pounds.\nshoes should have been listed as \u201cnew condition, worn second hand\u201d \nPretty much just feel robbed, will never use Stock X again.\n\nupdate: hilarious that stock x leaves a msg under my review saying \" oh we r so sorry, please just contact our support staff and we will resolve this\" stock x support staff will just completely ignore you because \" 3 days has elapsed\" ggggg sorry that i have a job n stuff guys n i had better things to do then worry about meeting a deadline to make a complaint about the second-hand shoes u sold me that was supposed to be brand new.\nalso, my roommate bought a pair of the \"white\" TN's n they are nearly yellow because of whatever conditions they were stored in. you would have to be mad to believe stock x is trustworthy and can source you \" brand new shoes\" they say they have \" and industry expert look at them\" well the guy who looked at my shoes could even be bothered to clean off all the dog hair and carpet that came on my shoes.","title":"SHOES WERE NOT BRAND NEW!!","stars":1,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-23","author":"James","text":"Still don\u2019t have the item I bought","title":"Still don\u2019t have the item I bought","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=26&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-23","author":"Andres Kievsky","text":"Their Australian pricing is buggy and will not correctly update, often showing the same amount in USD than in AUD and therefore misleading me into potentially buying an item cheaper than it is.
