I decided to order another color and this one came unauthentic. The sizing was off the material was completely different and you can clearly see the tags were in different fonts. Everything about the hoodie was off when compared to the 3 other hoodies I already own. I contacted customer service  and provided an abundance amount of pictures and they 1. Took forever to get back to me via email and 2. Said that the item has been observed by several authenticators and said that it was 100% authentic. They didn\u2019t even let me send it in for them to see it In person. The only option they gave me was to sell it back on StockX which they take a portion of the money anyway. Never buying from them again.

Do their authentication center really work?? are they working? The first time I received the Off-white Jordan they said it was their mistake and they did a refund, however, I got a penalty on another platform since it was ' fake '. The second time, recently, I bought the TS Fragment High, and again, the platform I used it said fake. However, StockX has never improved their skills and I am just scared it will happen again, to me or to anyone who is out there. They will do a refund and give you a 100usd voucher and end up with saying: ' it does not meet our StockX brand standards '. Why we are here to bear their responsibilities? We need to be scared and double-check if the shoes are real or not, at the same time we pay for the service fee and stuff. Is it really fair? What should I do now?
