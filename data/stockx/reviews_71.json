So within  last 24 hours suddenly 200 positive reviews. Each 20 of those  wrotten at the exact time the same day. Thats a total scam. They always  do that everytime they get bad reviews. And all those reviews always look alike . This is not the first time it happens.make sure you click the bad reviews button instead of the general reviews. They were sued by nike for fraud. You can google it.  This is a company with so many issues and no phone number . Is a hit  or miss when you order with them. Again dont believe their reviews , if you  didnt receive the item your order, or wrong item sent or you are not happy it will be a total headache as there is no phone number .
