The issue with the sneaker was minor but the bigger issue is that the damage wasn\u2019t mine. That was not the way the sneaker was sent and I\u2019m positive of that.\n\nThere\u2019s no way to plead a case, provide proof or even speak to someone about it. No matter what you\u2019re shut down. That\u2019s a big concern to me.\n\nMore transparency for those that keep the wheel turning at your company. After all without people selling, the market on the app would dry up. It\u2019s a flywheel that needs to keep turning on all ends to work.\n\nI hope things get better in the future. One bad experience can last much longer than a few positive ones. That\u2019s just the way it is.","title":"Lacks transparency with sellers","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=100&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-10-22","author":"Michael","text":"You need to show total price before final checkout.
