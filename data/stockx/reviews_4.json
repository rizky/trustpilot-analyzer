I understand that an invalid product is not necessarily the company\u2019s fault since they use third party vendors but the experience was definitely not positive. It was an intended birthday present and now I have nothing.\n\nRe: per Stockx Reply, I purchased the product April 23. I received a verification that it was shipped April 26th. I then received a confirmation that Stockx received the product at the verification center on May 1. It even highlights the event on the order process checklist, and confirms that the next step is verification. The following email states \"As you know, we have a multi-step authentication process to ensure that your order is correct. Unfortunately, the Jordan 7 Retro Championship Pack Cigar you recently purchased didn't make it through that process.\" So are you telling me that because you didn't receive it in a certain timeframe that the order was denied? Because that is not what is indicated in the series of emails I have been tracking for the last couple weeks. It appears to me that this was a fraudulent product. I am thankful that Stockx verifies, but I am not going to pretend to be thankful for a full refund, as all I have received is wasted time.","title":"My purchased product didn\u2019t meet\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=4&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"Jaden","text":"got what i wanted i just couldve got it for cheaper","title":"got what i wanted i just couldve got it\u2026","stars":3,"location":"NZ","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=4&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"Rich","text":"Worst company I\u2019ve dealt with ever. I had my sneakers canceled and they refunded me the same day. 10 days later I get the shoes, and then they recharge me for no reason without permission and I said I canceled my item and now you guys are recharging me and not refunding me. Under the law it states that a company cannot charge you for a item that you didn\u2019t order and that they don\u2019t have the rights to charge you if you didn\u2019t want it but happen to receive it later one. Staff was really rude when I was talking with online chat and ended chat when I was still taking with them and they were not helpful.
