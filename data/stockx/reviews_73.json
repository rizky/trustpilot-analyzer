The pair literally was wore and they still send them to me. I literally learned of the smell test from StockX and the shoes don\u2019t even smell brand new. I have a pair of brand new twisted 12s, From months ago with a stronger new smell than these have. They had scuffs and stains that Stevie wonder or any blind person could see for that matter and creased. They still sent me the shoes. This isn\u2019t the first time StockX has sent me a bad pair of shoes, but these were unacceptable. And if I ask for a new pair or money back, they won\u2019t honor it even though it\u2019s their fault. They told me before that a scuff was a manufacturer defect and their allowed to sent it to you.(as if you want to pay StockX prices for bad shoes. Right!). Your only option with StockX is to resell them and take a L because your not getting all your money back unless you sell them higher then what you paid plus StockX fees and shipping( good luck breaking even). Here\u2019s the icing on cake. STOCKX WANTS YOU TO RESELL SO THEY GET PAID EVEN MORE MONEY FOR THERE MISTAKES. but as I said before these shoes were actually worn, without the new smell inside them and had badly visible stains, so how do I go about selling them, they\u2019ll probably deny the bad pair they sent me, which is mind boggling to begin with. I will no longer buy from this company. Too many bad business practices. I only ever write reviews when I feel like I\u2019ve been done so wrong that no one else should feel what I felt. You can take my review with a grain of salt or you could be smart and save your self the (Money)hassle with these Clowns\n\nThis part is for the StockX reply. These guys our lairs. How you send me a pair of shoes as bad as these and now you need to review it. It wasn\u2019t reviewed when you sent them out. How about you guys take pictures of the shoes you review and the QR code and send the proof to us, so that when we get it we can know if they were swapped or something. I don\u2019t have anything from your checking process so if I do send pictures (which I\u2019m not)(waste of time like I said before)(not my first bad experience with StockX but definitely the last)your going to say that those aren\u2019t the shoes or some BS so why even reply to my message. I know how GreedX works. I\u2019ve bought a pair of white Oreo 5s Jordan that came beat up but new, and StockX just brushed it off and closed my case without giving me a chance to even argue the fact that they were beat up. The just sent a message saying the case was closed because their allowed to send manufacturer defective shoes to customers. But enough clearing up this smokescreen from StockX. Anyone who want to see my bad pair I got from StockX hit my email Freshwezy @ yahoo.com I will send you pictures so you can see this poor work performance. Since StockX hires Blind Workers(nothing against Blind Community). But let me say this, I\u2019ve spent thousands on StockX and most times shoes our ok\/decent at the least. But I\u2019ve brought at least 5 pair now that should have been returned to sender. Then I get stuck with them, after I paid StockX to make sure my shoes were good at the least. So Why would anyone want to pay for bad service when the our other companies doing the same and you can return them. Bye bye StockX, it\u2019s been fun(sort of)\n\n3-23-22 this the last edit. I just received my 2nd of 3 pairs of shoes from StockX(not buying from them again, just waiting on my last orders). Upon inspection of my QR Tag of the shoes I just received and checking the playoff 12s shoes I got that were bad. The QR tag was tampered with. So this was an Employee who swapped the shoes. No other explanation. It went from StockX to me, with no other contact but the Qr Tag was tampered with, come on StockX you gotta do better. Your employees don\u2019t get discounts to help prevent this type of stuff? Absolutely ridiculous and just another reason why I\u2019m done with you guys.
