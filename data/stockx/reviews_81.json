They provide the greatest place to sell counterfeit collectables, while calling it a service that protects from counterfeits. I ordered two sealed Pokemon products. I took video of me opening the package and photos of the obvious opening and resealing of the product that occurred from the seller. I reported it to stockX with photo proof. They offered me a tiny $20 promo for my trouble and refuse to refund the money. Are you kidding??? The whole premise of your platform is a lie. You cannot deliver the service you are promising and you don't provide any guarantees to the purchaser for even a refund when you mess up. What is your service for then??? Even eBay provides a money back guarantee. You are taking advantage of people, getting a cut of the sale for simply putting a sticker on everything (which often damages sealed products) and passing it through a warehouse not actually inspecting it at all. To top it off, they packed it loosely in the box and it was damaged in shipping, further rendering it worthless. I am happy to provide photos and video.","title":"StockX is the perfect platform for scammers","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=81&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-01-18","author":"Ibeth Canas","text":"Horrible they said they have a personal specialized in authentication  the shoes i order for my son where fake and i pay $385 they even not  had the original soles .

To provide some insight on the creation of Chinese and Japanese cards they are manufactured in this format, not the way the US makes their cards that if you rip a US card you can see a black lining in between the layers. Now what is special with these cards is that they are foiled so when ripping into these cards this is the outcome. These are 100% authentic.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n It\u2019s amazing what this company can accomplish with their own biased \u201cprofessionals\u201d.

I\u2019ll update this post after response from their legal team.\n\nI\u2019m an avid collector and have been collecting since Pok\u00e9mon was released in the 90\u2019s\u2026. All this company did was slap an \u201cauthentic\u201d sticker on the box and ship it out.    It\u2019s failed the light test and openly transparent.. It\u2019s a single piece of paper with printed images and doesn\u2019t have the black gum-paper between the card. BUT APPARENTLY THIS IS DUE TO THEIR QUOTE ABOVE\u2026. Funny isn\u2019t is? \n\n\nDon\u2019t use this company. I\u2019m trying to protect others from the same scam and will take them to court, not for a refund, but for them to investigate all other sales\/trades they\u2019ve made to unknowing consumers because they don\u2019t care who they scam.  \n\nAny avid collectors? Let me show you what they\u2019re selling.\nPlease, ask me for any evidence you need! I have emails from them to prove it.\n\nAND, in case you weren\u2019t aware- it\u2019s a federal offense to knowingly sell counterfeit\/fraudulent trademarked items in the United States. So, The company either doesn\u2019t know they sold fake cards, which means they\u2019re not professional. Or, they knowingly sold them..
