The product was described as having no damage or defects to either the shoes or the box. A few days after purchasing the shoes I was informed by Stock X that there was an issue with my original seller and that Stock X found me another seller with the exact same item at no cost to me. Little did I know that item they found me was a destroyed box that I was not made aware of. Since Stock X does not offer returns or refunds, you can imagine how upsetting this was to find out after spending over $300 on a pair of shoes. At no point in their authentication process did they think to let the customer know that they were going to receive a lesser item at the same price line. So when I emailed customer service, their first solution was to just offer me a $30 voucher. Why was my account not automatically credited that amount when Stock X switched out my item for one of lesser value? That right there just seems like a slap in the face. After several back and forth emails, I just get the run around that Stock X accepts damaged boxes. I realize this and made it painstakingly so that I understand their policy. What I don\u2019t understand is why I wasn\u2019t notified that my replacement was damaged. I was told it meets their guidelines on not having \u201ctoo\u201d much damage, whatever the hell that means. The box is completely ripped in the corner which is the most stable part of the box which means it\u2019s just going to fall apart with time. The box is also caved in and Stock X\u2019s solution to this whole ordeal was just to tape the box, not notify the customer of the change in product quality, still charge me the full price, then offer me a $30 voucher for their mistake that they refuse to fix after emailing them of their error. For a company that claims they know shoes and care about their customers, this is almost laughable. Oh, and this was my first and only purchase with Stock X. Word of advice to any future buyer, I highly recommend using G.O.A.T., kickscrew, or Flight Club for any shoe purchases. Not only do you get exactly what is expected and described, but they actually have the ability to correct their mistakes. Too bad I can\u2019t include any pictures so I can verify what I\u2019m talking about but I conveniently am not able to upload any pictures with this review.\n\nPart 2: I am very aware of your verification process as I\u2019ve previously stated. What you guys don\u2019t seem to understand is how it\u2019s ok to replace a non defective item with one that a customer can stick half of their hand through the product. Like I said, of course pictures can\u2019t be uploaded to prove my point.","title":"Buyer Beware!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=40&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-12","author":"Jonathan","text":"Ordered some Yeezy Slides about a month ago and still not received them tf takin so long","title":"Ordered some Yeezy Slides about a month\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=40&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-12","author":"Liam","text":"Item was not delivered.\nThe item wasn't delivered...

You did verify the product correctly.  But the picture showed a perfect box (which is important!) and the reality was a bit different.  The box wasn't a complete disaster, but it was not in mint condition by any stretch.  Little disappointed that the product made it through the warehouse.\nHowever, the worst part is that you put a sticker on the box stating, \"Inspected by STOCKX\"!  How could you put a sticker on a collectible?  I tried to peel it off and it was a complete disaster.  The part of the box that the sticker covered is completely ruined.  Why would you throw one of your stickers on a collectible box like that?  That was extremely disappointing.","title":"I purchased a rare LEGO kit.","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=40&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-12","author":"VtwoTheizzO","text":"Product arrived on time and as described.
