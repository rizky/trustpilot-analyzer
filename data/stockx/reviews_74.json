I have been using stock x for a while to sell and buy sneakers. In the beginning this company was great and efficient but now they\u2019re lacking extremely. Communication is KEY to everything and this company lacks extremely. Customer service is ehhh so so. They could do better. It\u2019s really hard to get a hold of anyone and it\u2019s only through email. How are you suppose to solve an issue Immediately when needed? There is no way! Buying and selling involves our money so there must be updates so we are aware of what is going on if things are taking longer then usual. There\u2019s this new \u201cbulk shipment\u201d for sellers that sounded amazing. Faster shipping. Items stay together which means \u201cfaster payouts\u201d. BS!! Total BS! I recently sold 3 pair of shoes and shipped them in bulk shipment and it is the worst thing ever! Shipment was delivered to StockX on Wed at 7am and only 1 pair of my 3 I sent in were accounted for. There have not been any updates as to where my 2 other pair of shoes are!!! I keep getting the run around from the employees of this company. So are they stealing? Are they swapping my shoes out for fakes? Is their customer service really just that bad? \nHonestly I have no idea! I have yet to get an answer, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend bulk shipping. If you\u2019re buying, make sure you buy everything 1 month in advance if needed for a specific date. If you\u2019re Selling, record and take pictures of everything you are selling to protect yourself because this company won\u2019t protect you. I understand we are all dealing with the aftermath of this pandemic but cmon. Management has to get their s**T together and take care of their employees to do better for their customers. A successful business cannot run without consumers. Shi**y customer service will bankrupt any company! Any service!","title":"Honesty! Sh** customer service!

It then became a back and forth between Fedex and StockX as to whether a refund would be issued.  Spoke with Fedex but was never able to speak with a live person at StockX.  Situation is very frustrating and upsetting because a significant amount of money was spent on merchandise.  There should definitely be some protocols and safeguards in place to prevent, or at least lessen the risk of packages being, so called lost, but I say stolen.  There are cameras in fedex and I definitely think if footage was reviewed they would be able to see who stole my merchandise.","title":"I was able to track my package all the\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=74&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-19","author":"Reyes","text":"I will never order the shoe from StockX due to not able to return the item. will have to figure out how to get $$ back with it","title":"I will never order the shoe from StockX\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=74&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-19","author":"Latoya","text":"Missing laces and have to jump through hoops after spending so much money.","title":"Missing laces and have to jump through\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=74&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-19","author":"Colin","text":"1.
