Then when you step it out and explain to them your problems what you\u2019ve done etc they give you generic messages back not actually addressing what you ask. Terrible app in Australia.\n\nUpdate to above, StockX replies with a generic response saying contact a generic email which is the very department I\u2019ve been dealing with. I expect more of the same but will update this review once I do.\n\nFinal update: Shipping label generated without a label, you get 2 days to ship. I contacted them and they responded 2 days later, sent the label and extended my shipping for 2 days. I shipped it on the morning of the 2nd day. I get a cancellation email 6 hours before my \u201ctime was up\u201d item was already shipped. I assume they are operating of their own Timezone not mine which is why another glitch, incorrect cancellation. I contact their support and round and round in circles we go \u201cyou didn\u2019t ship in 2 days\u201d generic responses even when I set out above and refer them to prior tickets with my extension.
