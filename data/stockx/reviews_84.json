The description was very misleading (TD) at end of description, small print... Spoke to 2 people that experienced the same issue. Send emails daily (while status showed not shipped yet from seller). They never responded. The shoes arrived at my house 1 week before estimated date (like if they rushed it) and then they said NO returns. I asked for a credit, NO response. Then they suggested I sell them on their site, after the price dropped and still charging me their 15% fee. Basically a 50% loss.\nHORRIBLE customer service. Rip off.

For the size 8.5 the inner sole too has a mark of numbers that I don't know for what but looks fake because real Jordan's never have these. And the quality is not what I expected. There are some flaws too outside. If I never saw that news I will never have an idea I got fake Jordan 11!!!
