I appreciate you taking the time to follow up with us to gain clarity on your results for order\u00a0########.\n\nWe know that you sent us a genuine Apple product, but the product sold was an\u00a0Apple Magic Trackpad 2 Space Gray with a code MRMF2LL\/A and we received a product with code: MRMF2Z\/A.\n\nWe know that both products seem to be the same, so we made an exception and we did not apply the penalty fee as per rule.\nThis joke of a company who has admitted my item was 100% authentic has cost me a buyer.

Prada x Adidas collaboration sneaker in black size 8 euro (Size 9 US). I admit that i made the mistake of putting the wrong size on stockx. I was expecting them to send my shoes back, however, they never did. A package tag was made and from the information I received from FedEx, the item was received by FedEx. So I'm under the impression that Stockx still had my shoes. I contacted stockx customer service which is a waste of time via chat and email. They contacted me back, kept telling me to be patient and that my case is top priority. It's been over 3 weeks I've seen my item. I finally received a email stating they are going to honor my payout which i was fine with since they lost my shoes or in my opinion was stolen by a employee. Now, I received a payout from stockx which is only 70% of the agreed payout based off a policy that I haven't read at all in terms and conditions. Their supposed policy states that if a item doesn't pass inspection and has to be sent back the seller, penalties will be put in place. And since my item didn't pass inspection and was lost\/ stolen by stockx that my payout will only 70% of the actual agreed payout. \n\nNow, this situation is oddly convenient for stockx to have that it caters to every issue I had with the company. Making it my fault that stockx lost my item and a accidental size conversion mistaken was made. \n\nI've spent of $20,000 with this company and this is the type of scams they run on individuals that they don't physically take too. Via phone or in person. The chat way of communication is jus a way to keep things distant from their customers who may actually have a problem. In this since I won't be purchasing anything from stockx anymore because they unfair and won't admit they are wrong. I literally live 15 mins from stockx headquarters in Detroit, MI. I could've gotten my shoes myself and resold them for substantial amount instead of taking at 30% loss.

Sooo\u2026.I ordered the purple and black Jordan Retro 13 Preschool sized shoes for my 5 year old daughter. The order came in a timely manner, but as soon as I opened the box there was a VERY strong marijuana smell. I said to myself, ok, hopefully the smell can air out once air gets to them. I placed the shoes on my girl and she whined in pain and told me to take them off because they were too tight. My daughter has had had Jordan\u2019s before and has never had a sizing issue. It makes me question the authenticity of the shoes overall.  I was so disappointed because I really wanted her to have these to match her school uniforms. I saw their return policy so I would have to take this as a loss. Also, a week later and the smell of the marijuana is still present!

Shipping, etc. was fast and smooth. Unfortunately the shoes were defective. After I wore them outside for the first time, the sole came off on both shoes. In theory I now have a legal right to reimbursement due to the material defect of the shoes. Even Stockx's own terms and conditions acknowledge that. However, customer support was \"unable to offer\" me a reimbursement. I'm going to return the shoes anyway and then sue, if necessary. Since Stockx is trying to transfer any risk with regard to the quality of the purchased goods to the customer I won't buy there again.\n\nEdit: After some further email exchange with customer support, I haven't returned the shoes but instead got my attorney involved. Stockx is quite clearly non-compliant with statutory warranty rights. I'll update once this has been upheld\/dismissed by the local court.\n\nOne can't really blame customer support because they clearly don't know any better. What was positive is that they were quite responsive which was generally nice. It is, however, quite frustrating emailing someone who has no idea when in addition the company policy seems to be \"just tell people complaining to f*** off\".","title":"Just don't (edited)","stars":1,"location":"DE","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=80&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-02-07","author":"Mohammad Almizel ","text":"Baddest company ever !!!!\nI made a purchase on 28th of January 170$ \nUntil today there is no updates !!!\nOnce I mailed the company they charged me again 170$ \nThey took total 340$ there are thieves never trust them I will write everyday here to make sure all people know about them I have all evidence","title":"Baddest company ever !!!!","stars":1,"location":"KW","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=80&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
