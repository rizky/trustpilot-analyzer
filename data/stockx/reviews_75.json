[{"date":"2022-03-11","author":"CMD","text":"Sneaker quality inspection is a scam!  Don't buy or you will be stuck. \n\nI ordered a pair of sneakers from StockX for my wife.  StockX verified them and shipped them to me. My wife tried them on for 2 minutes inside.  They weren't comfortable so I listed them on StockX.    Someone purchased them from me so I shipped them back to StockX.  StockX said the condition was not up to their standards.  REDICULOUS since they are in exact condition that they approved when I bought them.  Now I am stuck with $300 shoes.  DON'T BE A FOOL.  They sent me pictures of their current review but couldn't produce the pictures of the original review when I bought them.\n-----------------\nAdding additional comments after StockX's response.   You can see StockX's response is vague and generalized, does not address specifics of my issue, and then put's the onus on me to contact them again after I've contact them about six directly.  They have no intent to resolve this.  They hope you think the issue ultimately gets resolved but it hasn't and I have no faith in StockX to do the right thing.\n\n----UPDATE---\nIt's now almost two months later and StockX is holding my shoes hostage.  They have neither paid me nor returned the shoes to me.  I highly recommend buying and selling sneakers elsewhere.","title":"Sneaker inspection is high risk gamble","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=75&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-11","author":"Lindsey Gannaway","text":"Do not trust this business.\n\nI placed an order, then asked a question about the shipment of the order via customer service email.

This response below is nothing more then a smoke screen. The package did not come directly from the seller it goes through Stockx. So if the package is lost the only person who can file a claim to resolve the issue is Stockx. If you can\u2019t reach Stockx they can\u2019t file a claim. In my case Stockx knows I cannot file a claim from my end (hence the smoke screen.)
