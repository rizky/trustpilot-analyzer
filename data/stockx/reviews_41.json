The shoes arrived on time, great. However, the shoes came with a giant dent in the toe box that was very noticeable. It\u2019s as if they were not inspected prior to being sent to me as there was no damage to the shipping box, however the shoebox it came in was crunched. I was able to receive a refund for these shoes, however now the shoes are at a higher price and I am trying to wait for the price to come back to near what I originally paid for them. There should be some sort of additional compensation in place for customers who are screwed over by incompetent employees. This is frustrating and StockX just lost a customer, I\u2019ll be taking my business to GOAT.","title":"Disappointing Transaction","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=41&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-11","author":"Andrew","text":"If I would have known it would have taken this long I would have chose another vendor or got my money back.
