I reached out to customer support and they said they didnt see anything wrong and asked me to reach out to my bank\/paypal. Reached out to them twice and they said they werent blocking any payments. My bank even said they had to approve 3 times just fir stockx is to block my payment again. I mailed stockx with all this information and pointing iut the issue on their side and I get no reply anymore. If you look online there are plenty of people being lied to by stockx. Complaining will just lead ibto your account getting banned. Reaching out via review website wont get anywhere. They just tell you to cintact support just to ignore you again. They should audit this company. For context I have bought more than 30 products from them, but when they decided a jacket I biught from their platform that I wanted to resell to them was \u201cfake\u201d they pretty much blocked any further purchases I wanted to make. The jacket i submitted for a sell even still had their original stockx tag on it. This company is a joke.\n\nUpdate: so its been a week since I reached out and only yesterday they acknowledged there is an issue while 2 other colleagues said they don\u2019t see an issue at all and tell me to go talk to my bank and paypal twice. Aside from the fact they make me wait 2 days between every reply, they haven\u2019t made any progress as far as solving the issue. So the last employee who rplied finally acknlowedged the issue but that is literally all she did. Nowhere did she mention why this is happening and nowhere did she mention they will solve it and when. Had to send another email just to ask her to solve the issue and she says she just forwarded it to the team responsible for this and another day passes by\u2026 I dont know whether they are doing this on purpose but these people anything but customer friendly.\n\nAlso please stop telling people to reach out to customer support just to do nothing\u2026 please make an actual attempt at solving the issue.","title":"App keeps saying I cant make a purchase\u2026","stars":1,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=57&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"Taylor","text":"Pretty sure the shoes were not brand new and.

I bought shoes that were suppose to be brand new but I was sent used shoes with several flaws. I sent several pictures with proof. When I requested a refund I was told to resell the damaged shoes on their website. Which would have resulted in StockX being paid again and another customer receiving damaged shoes. Horrible business practices. Filed a complaint with my bank for the blatant fraud. NEVER AGAIN, BUYERS BEWARE!!!!\n\n\nUPDATE: StockX response to my complaint was to band me from their website as if I would ever purchase anything from them again. So glad they responded so everyone can see how StockX responds to their customers with threats and no results.","title":"SCAM!!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=57&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"Gianna","text":"Still havent recieved my package , its been over 15 days !","title":"Still havent recieved my package m","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=57&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"Anna","text":"I placed my first order weeks ago and just received an email stating my order had been cancelled.
