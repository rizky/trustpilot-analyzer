It has taken weeks, many emails, photos from us etc. just to get StockX to agree to take it back and give us a refund - and only after we purchased the \"same\" set directly from the official Lego store and could \"prove\" to StockX what they had sent was fake.

The left shoe had StockX and Nike labels, while the right one did not. \n\nI thought about contacting support about the lousy quality of the right shoe. But after reading about the company\u2019s support experience, I realized that it is not likely that my concern will be addressed. So I figured that I can go with those glue stains even though they were way too bad for a factory defect. So even though I had a suspicion that one of the shoes was fake, I kept them. \n\nI removed the tags. After I had worn shoes once for an hour, my suspicions that one shoe is fake got solid. There was disproportionate leather wear on the right shoe. After one walk it was too much. So now I am confident that StockX sent me the original left shoe and the counterfeit right one. \n\nI feel that this company will not help me with this situation for a couple of reasons. One, is I got to shoes one week after they were delivered. I was out of the house for a spring break, but StockX does not care since they leave only three business days for concerns. Two, I removed the StockX tag. It does not change the situation at all since the tag was only attached to the left shoe, which I have no concerns about. Three, their reputation for resolving issues suffers. \n\nI will probably never wear these shoes. I am disappointed that I have wasted $200 on something that does not meet not my expectations but fundamental integrity. \n\nI contacted support about this but do not expect my issue to be resolved. I have a friend running the sneaker youtube channel. I will get to him with this story if StockX does not provide an adequate solution by the end of the week. I am sure that people deserve to know how this company runs the business.","title":"That was my first and probably the last experience with StockX.","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=29&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
