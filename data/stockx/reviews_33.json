They offered me a 20 dollar coupon towards another pair. Why would I ever purchase a new pair after my horrible experience. This is their response.\n\nThanks for using StockX!\n \nThanks for providing me with those photos of the QR code on the tag and the issues on your Jordan 1 Nova.\n \nAfter looking at the photos provided I noticed that this pair is within the production standards for the Jordan 1 Nova and was cleared for retail release. We unfortunately do not have control over the manufacturer's production standards and must work with products that they have cleared for release. The common manufacturing variances you are referring to on the shoe occurs when shoes are mass produced in large quantities. however I would like to offer you a $20 code towards a future purchase to help rectify the situation.","title":"Don\u2019t buy at stockx total rip off","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=33&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-17","author":"Tia Danielle","text":"Still waiting for my bag \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","title":"Still waiting for my bag \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=33&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-18","author":"Dexter Lovett","text":"Horrible first time experience","title":"Horrible first time experience","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=33&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-18","author":"Adrienne","text":"The system reverted to the initial size always highlighted rather than the one I ordered.
