I ordered a pair of Bape Stas but they were marked as delivered even though nothing came that day. Contacted StockX and was told to make sure I met requirements such as filling in their form within 3 days. I filled it in and then a day later I got told they cannot do anything about it! Thank god they apologised to me profusely though!!! That really helped me soothe the \u00a3350 loss I took. Any replies to their emails have gone unanswered. Please do not deal with StockX, find deals through trusted members on Facebook groups.","title":"Terrible customer service","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=19&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-27","author":"Pride","text":"Both shoes I bought were scuffed. \nTerrible experience","title":"Both shoes I bought were scuffed","stars":3,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=19&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-27","author":"Rob","text":"We paid for sneakers.

STOCKX please don't reply to posts to convince other customers you are apologetic and helpful, when you are actually not doing anything!\nDO NOT USE THIS SERVICE. We dropped the parcel off at the UPS collection point and obtained proof of this. However, this parcel did not seem to made it anywhere else. UPS have confirmed that they are able to trace the parcel, but the agreement is between StockX and UPS and not with you. StockX refuse start an investigation because it hasn't started it's journey. So even though you have done your bit and dropped it off with the StockX label at a recommended drop off point and even have proof of this, there is nothing you can do because StockX won't help you and UPS will only deal with StockX.
