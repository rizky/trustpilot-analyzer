You can't review what you are purchasing as they have your payment details stored and if you click buy and expect to review your order then forget it.

Its a scam. They are unwillingly leading people to buy things they don't want by pressing buttons incorrectly and no review and clarity on what you are buying.

Itd be great if that were the case cause the ranking system previously sucked. of the 10 million users i was in the top 50k by number items, top 1%  but for some reason it made sense to them to put top 1% as the 99% rank in portfolio. besides that long tangent on how dumb their UI is and the portfolio tab.
