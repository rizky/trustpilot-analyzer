Passed from team to team no response from emails only have a live chat which the people monitoring it do not have the authority to cancel or refund anything. Sold a \u00a39000 item and have been isolating with COVID. emailed straight away for them to say i still have to send this within 2 business days. So they wanted me to leave the house with Covid to go to the post office for a shoe? After explaining that i cannot do this i was told the order would be cancelled at no fee. 2 days later heard nothing, and see my shipping was extended for 2 days. I message again explaining the situation. In this time i have sold the shoe elsewhere as i am told that its being cancelled as i couldn't ship in time due to my isolation. I then have a message to say my shipping has been extended again to cover my isolation period - when i had been told this whole time that this wasn't possible and my item is being cancelled. Messaged them every day since to have this cancelled as i no longer have the shoe from their misinformation and all i am told is that they have passed this to their team and someone will get back to me. I have also had about 10 shoes from 2019 that i haven't ever received and are showing as pending still on my account which they have just ignored all of my emails about.
