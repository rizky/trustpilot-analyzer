I am usually encouraging five star review giver. First time I have used StockX this year in March, 2022. My son wanted to buy a per of air Jordan, he did well this year and earned some cash doing some chores, we ordered them on 22 March and they promptly  arrived 31 March but, our excitement was quickly dampen when we saw it was a child's 13, not adult.  The same day,  I contacted company through their complex website, downloaded item\u2019s pictures, pictures, gave my order number, wrote them Email explaining the mishap.  Three days later,  I get an email, explaining they will not take returns or exchanges or give credit. But, I can sell them. I\u2019m a very busy individual who works 12 hours shifts in a in a healthcare setting. I do not wish to be a shoe salesman as well with my hard earn money. I feel angry and disappointed.  This is a shady business\u2019 practice. I spent $175.52 dollars and my son still needs shoes! I do not wish anyone to be in the situation. The time I spent with my own money to resolve this mess with StockX cost me a lot more than $175.52!!!  As I researched, I went into different website reviews and  noticed that this is a trend with this company. They  have poor 1 1\/2 star rating.  Many are complaining about no exchange refunds etc. some claim products are fake. I will be highly concerned when I\u2019m purchasing from this  seller. Good luck!","title":"Buyer Be Very Careful with StockX!!!!!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=55&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
