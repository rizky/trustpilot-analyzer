My very 1st order from this site, and they sent me a fake pair of Yeezy's. It is beyond me how they promote 100% authentic and even I spotted the shoe was fake before I took it out the box. \nI ordered my wife the exact same shoe from footlocker, so I had a valid pair to compare. The box label has 6 sizes listed, real 380's have 3. The shoe had 2 Adidas tags, real 380's have 1. Then the biggest and most evident issue was the design on the back of the shoe. The design should be on each side of the seam coming down the back, but the Stock X shoe was all together with no design separation. Then customer service is damn near impossible to reach. I filed a claim and still waiting!! I will never ever ever buy from them again.\nA claim was filed on the Stock X website at 12pm est on 11\/1\/21.
