Stockx said they give the seller 2 business days to ship the shoes. Which is untrue. After 4+ business days past of the seller not shipping my shoes to Stockx, they informed me the had to find another seller. Now I had to wait for new seller to ship my shoes to Stockx for verification. Then once shoes were delivered to Stockx it took another 4 business days for shoes to get to Stockx and be verified. I\u2019ve had to wait over two weeks to get my shoes from Stockx, where my bf who ordered shoes on the same day as me received his over a week before mine. I\u2019m more just unhappy with the lack of transparency and communication. Don\u2019t say you\u2019ll give the seller 2 business days to ship, when you don\u2019t. Especially when I\u2019m paying you these expensive verification and shipping fees.

I spoke to 2 different reps and neither have a clue and only saying \"we will look into it\". Apparently there is no communication between them and their own warehouse. Very disappointing experience that I would have to be running behind a respectable company like this. Will definitely use Ebay instead in the future.","title":"While I respect autheticating products\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=58&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"PST","text":"It took quite long for delivery and with admin. charge.","title":"It took quite long for delivery and\u2026","stars":3,"location":"HK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=58&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-01","author":"Jorge","text":"The shoes I got are fakes the bottoms soles don't match the patterns are defective and there is a piece of rubber of another color embedded in the sole .
