Despite 2 or my previous orders being cancelled as the hoodies didn't pass the authentication process this 3rd attempt actually went through. \n\nThe Hoodie was meant to be delivered on 31\/03\/2022 by UPS, however, all I got from UPS that day was an email saying that my order has been delivered, yet there was no order at the door (which is where UPS supposedly left it, even though I was home). \n\nSince I already once had such experience with StockX, I knew what to do. I filled out the \"begin investigation\" form on StockX website, provided all of my information, order numbers etc., attached a copy of the affidavit and submitted the case hoping that someone competent enough would be able to help. \n\nOn 01\/04\/2022 I was contacted by Dalma (CRM:04580001604) from StockX. She asked me to provide her with details about my account which I did, then she sent me another email asking me to send her a copy of an affidavit, which I did. While we are at it, why the F did I have to attach a copy of an affidavit when filling out the \"order missing\" form, if I end up sending it to the agent in the end anyway? \nAnyway, sent her a copy of the affidavit, twice actually since she was not happy with my handwriting in the first one and got sent a link to StockX identity verification. \n\nStandard procedure right? Been there, done that before. WRONG, as about 10 of my attempts to scan both my passport and national ID failed. I even tried uploading an image. \nBoth the webcam on my MacBook and the camera on my iPhone have high resolution, yet according to StockX the image was not clear.\n\nHaving been unable to complete my ID verification on StockX website, which if I may add is a f**ck up on their end not mine, I decided to email Dalma and let her know that the ID verification system on StockX must be experiencing technical difficulties so instead I attached a photo copy of my passport and sent it to Dalma, hoping that she would be competent enough to do something about it. \n\nAs of today, 7th April 2022, it's been 4 days without any reply from Dalma or any other StockX rep. I have tried to file a new case 3-4 times, however, it seems like StockX has decided to deliberately ignore me which is exactly what happened before when I tried to cancel one of my orders. \n\nThere is no such thing as customer support on StockX, none. The way they respond to every case on here is by redirecting us back to stockx\/contact page on their website, however, we all know that the reason why we post on here is that it's impossible to get anyone to reply through their website and it's a fact. \nI bet they won't even deal with my issue here directly, but will simply tell me to contact them on stockx support. It's a joke, this company takes your money, doesn't deliver the product, tries to create an illusion that you are getting help and then they just leave you with no contact, and obviously they keep your money. \n\nI strongly suggest potential customers look at other options like KLEKT or GOAT because StockX is a scam site. \n\nI will be opening a case with my bank so I can hopefully get my money back and I will doubt I will ever do any business with you crooks.","title":"Scam website, they will collect your money and you will never receive your product.","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=47&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-07","author":"KH","text":"I loved the swiftness of service but I don\u2019t like that I can\u2019t exchange or return items.","title":"I loved the swiftness of service but I\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=47&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-07","author":"FedEx sucks ass","text":"FedEx sucks ass","title":"FedEx sucks ass","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=47&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-07","author":"tiffany","text":"literally got completely different shoes and they wasn't even my size........","title":"literally got completely different\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=47&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-07","author":"Mike Roberts","text":"I attempted to cancel my order which was a duplicate of our grand daughters order.
