Like Mark Whelan in the comments below said, \u201cThe site is unclear, i can bid for an item that won't get accepted but other bids at a much lower price get accepted, I believe its something to do with the region so, therefore, the site is terrible to use and I advise look elsewhere for your items.\u201d. \n\nI too has a similar experience. I had bid on a pair of Jordan Retro 6 DMP at $275 (2022-03-01 @ 9:15am) and someone won with a lower bid of $265 (2022-03-01 @ 9:35am). I reach out to Customer Service to ask why and they said, \u201cBids which are higher than those of other clients and even so you cannot buy the sneakers you want as in this case in which you had a $274 Bid for some Jordans 6 Retro DMP and another customer won them with a lower Bid of $266. \n \nThis normally happens when the buyer is located outside the country where the closest Ask is located and the difference in taxes and duties will mean that someone who has to pay less for this can match the seller.\n \nThe easiest option will always be to use the buy now button in which you will not have to wait and see how other buyers get the same product that you want while you are still waiting for some seller to offer them at a lower price.\u201d.\n\nLuckily I took screenshots of my bid and the winning bid plus I have my email confirmation stating the time of my bid. I have screen shot of the winning bid on the site as I didn\u2019t receive a next bid email. But why would I if it\u2019s not higher than mine. Something is not right here!!!\n\nNow tell me how does that make sense. Am I not bidding to avoid having to pay the asking price? Am I not paying more in having to pay the $USD when I bid? I see the conversion to $CAD (0.79) so how is the seller loosing if I\u2019m being charged by my creditor in $USD ($1) with all the additional fees applied on top? In the end it\u2019s in my best interest to bid as I\u2019m paying a lot more than what StockX states I\u2019m paying because they cannot give an accurate currency exchange rate when it changes daily. \n\nAnother incident, I won a bid on Jordan Proto Max 720 Wolf Grey Volt (Size 9.5) for $100 on Sunday 2020-07-12. 4 days later they issue me a refund (Thank you) on Thursday 2020-07-16 to tell me that the sellers shoes did not pass the verification process. I was not pleased considering that I asked myself, how could the seller get them there so quick if shipping would start on Monday and to pay $$$ for overnight shipping to StockX by Tuesday, verified Wednesday, then send a refund email on the Thursday. Which seller pays for overnight shipping on a $100 pair of shoes to not pass and on top of that to receive a $15 penalty fee for a failed inspection. Clearly the shoes weren\u2019t worth much to the seller to takes loss on their expenses. It just seemed suspicious. \n\nIn conclusion and to be honest, I feel something illegitimate is going on with the hole sneaker culture. I wish the brands would just allow pre-orders on shoes. This would eliminate 3rd party vendors, botts, and scammers. If I think this then they most likely have thought of it and don\u2019t want to do it for some unexplained reasons.","title":"Bitter Sweet Unfortunately","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-05","author":"hariyadi tengjoyo","text":"Hi, I sold 3 pairs of shoes, but you didnt make the payment, you made the payment to someone else bank account, and my payment account information change to your account information( stock x recipient GA) when I questioned to your cs thru chat you , only asked me to reset password but you didnt send my payment, if you dont want make the payment dont try find the excuse, the mistaken made by you why I should lost my payment, please return my 3 pairs shoes if you dont want make the payment, I never change any my payment information on my hyperwallet, I asked your agent many times to investigate, because my bank said you never sent the payment, I made the selling with u for been 1 years and never had problem with the payment, suddenly now u didnt send me the payment, please make the payment","title":"Stock X doesnt paid my sold sneakers!!","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-07","author":"ndene drane","text":"bought  some  adidas  zx   5000  no message  on  the  site  to  say  i  had  bought  the  trainers  no  e  mail   \ni had  to  go  the   bank and  get  a   bank  statement  to  prove  i  had paid  for  the  trainers  and  e mail   to  stock   x\nso  got  in  contact  with  them   basically  the  lied  and   messed me  about   refund  first  of  all  then  it didnt  happen  then  told    voided  charge  on  your  account  no  money  has  come   out   lying  again  so  i  used  agmail  e mail account  to  email the  boss  of  stock x    then  i  got  e   mail  saying  proof  of  purchase sent  to your gamail  e  mail  slight  problem  is  i  nevr  gave  them  my  gmail  e  mail   so  just  more  lies   \nand they  have deleted  my  stock  x  account  email  and  password  dont  work  anymore\nno  worries  im  gonna  keep   on  going  with  this    for wasting  my  time  and  messing  me  about  and  been  clever   and  ive  got  the  bank  onto  it  getting  my  refund  had  enough  of  clowns","title":"bought  some  adidas  zx   5000  no\u2026","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=76&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-07","author":"Adam Greenwood","text":"Ordered some shoes, they were the wrong size and stock x don't offer returns.
