They do not any provide any reasonable recourse  for authenticating damage\/fake shoes and sending them to the purchaser. Specifically, I purchased a new pair of Jordan Bordeaux 6. Immediately, when I open the shoe box, I noticed threads sticking out in numerous places. In my 20 years of buying Jordan's from Footlocker and Champ's I have never had this issue. I paid nearly $300 for a pair of shoes from Stockx with threads sticking out all over the tongue of the pair of Jordan's.
