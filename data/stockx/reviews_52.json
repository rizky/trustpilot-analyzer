Both pairs of shoes arrived within the timeframe provided by StockX to not receive any late delay penalty. I received an email that one of the pairs failed authentication and they are sending them back. Whenever I looked at it I could tell they clearly switched the pairs up. So I reach out to customer support immediately to let them know they made a mistake. I received a response days later and they said they\u2019re sorry they messed up but they can\u2019t reverse the cancellation. But get this; they\u2019re keeping the second pair as a verified sale. And they\u2019re excuse to me was \u201cthe beauty of our platform is you can resell at anytime.\u201d With no consideration to the time I have and will lose on this deal. And I also have lost value as the shoe\/size is not worth what it was when sold. StockX should\u2019ve just paid me out and kept the shoes to resell themself if they \u201ccan\u2019t reverse\u201d a cancellation. It\u2019s clear the original rep was just lazy. Does StockX not have sellers sending multiple pairs at a time? Is that not a thing? Terrible experience and will not be using the platform to sell again. I can\u2019t even imagine the buying process and don\u2019t even want to go there. They will tell me \u201cthe money didn\u2019t come. We cancelled. That\u2019s the beauty of our platform.

Per StockX's website, the seller has 2 business days to send the item to StockX. I checked the status daily, and StockX was still waiting for the seller to send them the item even after 5 business days [7 days, including the weekend] -- they never received it for authentication, but a week after my purchase, sent me an email stating that the item didn't meet their authenticity standards. Normally, I would feel very appreciative of fakes being weeded out, but this cancellation of my order due to 'authenticity' came at the EXACT SAME TIME as a sudden jump in the price of the shoes I purchased. The price of the shoe jumped significantly the day AFTER my purchase was finalized. The timing is EXTREMELY fishy on this, and it seems that the seller and StockX determined that they could make more money by cancelling my order and putting the item back up for sale at a higher price. This was my first and only experience with StockX, but I won't be going back. The price of this item went back down after that brief jump in price, and I went straight to GOAT instead.","title":"TERRIBLE experience with StockX","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=52&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-05","author":"Jay","text":"Stock X wants me to write a review on shoes I don\u2019t have.
