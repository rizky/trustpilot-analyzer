Bought some Jordan 1 Electro Oranges and they came with a scuff and a stain. As they didn\u2019t respond to my email on my complaint, I decided to resell them. When I resold them, they were flagged as stained and they cancelled my resale, even though they authenticated when they bought it the first time. I\u2019m telling you right now, don\u2019t ever shop with them. Their website charged me three times and luckily my bank got involved for them and refunded me once but I got 2 pairs. As I tried to resell the second pair, they kept making more and more excuses whenever I complained, how they didn\u2019t get any emails from me, and they kept saying how much they felt bad and they couldn\u2019t do anything!! Yes you could, you could refund it or get me a new pair or at least some sort of code or credit. Instead they just decided to time waste and keep talking about their so called \u201cdeadstock\u201d trainers.
