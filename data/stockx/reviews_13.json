D.","text":"The ordering\/receiving process itself was fine, but Stock X does not do a good job w\/  authentication. I paid almost $300 for my Mocha peach Jordan\u2019s (double the original price). Once I received my shoes & upon further inspection, I knew my R shoe was authentic & L shoe was a fake. I can tell by the deepness\/groove\/look of the logo, pattern of bottom of the sole, & other features. Still looks like the L shoe is genuine leather though & the difference is slight, so at the end of the day I just decided to keep the purchase because StockX return policy is a real hassle and the pain\/risk of having to go through the purchase process all over again of the same shoe is not worth it. It\u2019s just sad for $300, I know in the back of my mind only 1\/2 of my Jordan\u2019s are real :(( Sadly, I will not be purchasing again through StockX & risking receiving another fake.","title":"Be wary of Fakes","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=13&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-30","author":"Andrea","text":"I loved the shoes perfect material and matches w everything and have gotten many compliments","title":"I loved the shoes perfect material and\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=13&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-30","author":"Ripped Off","text":"Order never arrived","title":"Order never arrived","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=13&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-30","author":"Rob Wiseman","text":"I ordered shoes that I paid over $400, and never received.
