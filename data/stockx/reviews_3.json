It said that the purchase went through but it showed that it was missing part of our address. When I pushed the \"review your order\" it showed that our ordered had not been completed, so I pushed the complete order button again. This caused another order to be placed, and your website does not allow returns and has no way to contact. Your website is very misleading and now I'm stuck with 2 pairs of the same shoes. Very displeased with your business and will not be ordering from you again.","title":"I ordered a pair of shoes for my son's\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"Jeremy","text":"Very slow shipping.","title":"Very slow shipping.","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"Bryan","text":"So far I have to give one star because its taken  longer than it should\u2019ve for the seller to send to you guys to start, along with this not going accordingly being my first time ordering.

Everything is done through a chat and getting a responsive back takes a while. They must be understaffed because when I asked about a phone number to call they said they were still developing that process. Seems baffling to not have that line of support when phones have been around much longer than a chat service. There are numerous forums and reviews of packages being stolen and StockX not taking the action seriously or ever returning the purchase price. My package was stolen and after getting the runaround I contacted PayPal for my cash return. Got it resolved quickly. Cannot use StockX again because account has been terminated. I could care less because I got my money back promptly. I would advise reading the terms of service before purchasing because StockX holds all the power and they can simply decide not to do anything and the loss is on the consumer. Just a bad business.","title":"Terrible customer support and near\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"TF","text":"Verified a fake Vlone Tshirt \nI\u2019m disappointed and no one got back to me after I emailed customer support about it.","title":"Verified a fake Vlone Tshirt","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=3&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-06","author":"Molly","text":"They were fake\n\nThey were literally sponge .
