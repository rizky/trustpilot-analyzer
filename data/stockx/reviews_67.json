I contacted customer service and they offered me $35. I told them that is not sufficient for a purchase of over $300. They falsely advertised and \u201cverified\u201d the sneakers to be new but when I received them it was obvious they were worn, scuffed and visibly dirty. They should\u2019ve sent the shoes back to the seller and\/or sold them as used sneakers. I paid money for new shoes as advertised and got used shoes. StockX is truly disappointing and only interested in their commission. No standards, no customer service. If I had a white name I\u2019m sure they would have continued to speak to me after I requested the case be elevated to a manager. However my education is white and so is my lawyer. I will be pursuing this with all review sites, BBB and civil claims court. I\u2019m the right one.","title":"Damaged\/ dirty\/ worn.

The shoes I received were in poor quality. They were dirty, scuffed, already had slight creasing before even trying them on and the leather on one side of the shoe was completely wrinkled and warped. I emailed all photos (with all the flaws clearly visible) and received a quick response saying they would only refund $30 and there would be no exchanges.. but I could resell the shoes. I would not feel comfortable reselling the shoes in their current state knowing how unhappy I was receiving them myself. My replies have unfortunately gone unanswered for the last week. I realize StockX does authentication checks but quality checks should be just as important. These shoes should have never been sent out especially for a resell price and with them being labeled as brand new condition.","title":"Scuffed shoes, terrible customer service.","stars":2,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=67&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-26","author":"OSCAR CASTELLANOS","text":"Horrible service if a package gets lost they can\u2019t help you at all.
