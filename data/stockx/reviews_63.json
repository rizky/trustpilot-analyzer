Much to our surprise the tracking showed delivered on 3\/19\/22 however we did not receive the shipment as indicated. When trying to get in contact with StockX has been impossible. There is not a chat box to speak with anyone nor a working 800#. I feel like I just gave $309.86 to a fake internet company and also have a very disappointed teenager. So far I wouldn\u2019t recommend StockX.com to anyone.
