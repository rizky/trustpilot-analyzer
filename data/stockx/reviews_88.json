There is no number to call and no live chat. Only prefilled answers to questions. Then they make you fill out a form that says a response can take up to 48 hrs. Which is a major issue because we only have 48 hrs to ship a product once sold. So if there is an issue there is no way to get ahold of someone to fix it. Then they charge you astronomical fees which makes selling on the platform pointless because you barely make any money after the fee or worse, lose money on my case.","title":"Horrible customer service","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-14","author":"Lisa H","text":"Purchased a pair of shoes for an Xmas present for my son and was charged and given a delivery time of before Xmas.  One week later and still says \"waiting for seller to ship\".  After trying for hours to get a live answer, was told it was an \"oversight\" and \"for some reason\" the seller was given longer but now they can't guarantee I'll get by Xmas and that I'll even get product at all.  And they will not pay extra to expedite to a customer when they have made an error.  Offered me a refund since they did charge me one week ago but that obviously doesn't do me any good as now I don't have time to get the product for Xmas.  Waiting to see how this turns out and hopeful I can modify this review with a happy ending.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you for responding.  The sneakers I purchased were released in April.  My order was confirmed on Wednesday, December 8th and the seller was given until the end of the day today to ship.  That is four business days.  Not sure why that differs from your stated reply.","title":"Xmas disappointment","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=88&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-14","author":"Eric Collins","text":"I purchased a new pair of shoes that was scuffed and looked like they have been worn please don't get scammed purchasing shoes from them.

I placed my order and due to \u201cproblems with their system\u201d didn\u2019t realize the seller didn\u2019t ship until six days later (seller had two days) when I contacted them.  Rather than provide me with a replacement - as stated on their website \u201cno extra cost\u201d to customer - they said \u201csometimes the system doesn\u2019t work\u201dand couldn\u2019t find a replacement and decided to cancel my order and issue a refund (which I will receive in 2-7 days).  Yet, I can go back online and order my own replacement from their site for $30 more than original price.  When I inquired about this, customer service told me I didn\u2019t understand their costing models.  This was their mistake.  They overlooked the seller shipping deadline.  I could of ordered a replacement item four days ago and would of received over holidays.  Why they wouldn\u2019t of solved my problem immediately today by allowing me to buy replacement pair with a promo code to honour original price I don\u2019t know.  Instead no solutions were offered, no attempts were made to offer any additional support.  I was also told their customer service doesn\u2019t support a phone conversation.  Terrible.

Thankfully I always read the reviews and policies of the company's I choose to do business with. Thanks to most of these reviews and company's policies I don't think I'm willing to do business with stockx.com at this time. What really didn't make sense to me is why would a company not refund a customer for some shoes that got ordered by mistake or better yet by pushing a back button. Hopefully stockx.com will try to have some better customer service in the near future as their prices seem very tempting but I'm not a gambler and would prefer paying a little more for a sure thing.
