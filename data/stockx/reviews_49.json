[{"date":"2022-04-06","author":"Dreux","text":"These people are a poor display of doing business. They will lie and steal your money if they have to. I purchased some shoes that were to small and since they told me I couldn\u2019t return them I had to sale them. Well I posted them on Stockx the same exact day and they sold the same exact day. I shipped the shoes off on a Monday and they received them that Thursday. These people had the nerve to tell me that the shoes were worn. Not only were they never worn because they were to small but they still had the same green verification tag on them for when they sold them to me!! I even sent pictures to the first representative pleading my case for three days straight. She eventually stopped emailing me back which is pathetic. Then, here comes another representative that not only tell me that the shoes didn\u2019t pass because they were \u201cworn\u201d but this guy also included that I sent them a size that I didn\u2019t purchase!  These people are crooks and they don\u2019t do their job properly. I will never do business with this company again. Once I experienced this with them I just had to google if this was common and to my surprise it actually was. So be careful with purchasing from these crooks.","title":"Never Again","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-06","author":"\ud83d\ude21","text":"I still haven\u2019t received my order and I can\u2019t return it .","title":"I still haven\u2019t received my order and I\u2026","stars":1,"location":"MA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=49&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-06","author":"Praanshu","text":"Always messing my orders up.

After contacting 4 customer service representatives, I was finally advised that the bag supposedly hadn\u2019t passed authentication, and would not be shipped.  Disappointed.
