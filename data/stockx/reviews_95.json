An issue occurred with the order so they said they\u2019d refund me the money within 24 hours. I had by then paid twice, once via PayPal and once via IDEAL. I got the PayPal refund after I e-mailed them saying I haven\u2019t received the refund within 24 hours but after then I still didn\u2019t receive my IDEAL refund. Since then I\u2019ve constantly contacted stockX demanding a refund and they are literally ignoring me. I also contacted IDEAL which contacted the PPRO company that is also not responding. About almost a week ago I e-mailed stockX again and they replied saying they\u2019ll look into the case, I have e-mailed them twice since then demanding a reply and I still haven\u2019t gotten one. A company that probably gets millions can\u2019t refund \u20ac270 euro\u2019s. They have scammed me and are treating me as if I can re-earn the money in a minute. This company is absolutely horrible with treating their costumers and the customer service couldn\u2019t possibly get any worse! I\u2019ve now on 13-11-2021 recontacted them via the app saying that they have to reply but still, no reply!

Selling is easy albeit a high cost in seller fees you need to pay, unless you sell a lot.\nI will give them kudos for making a good iPhone app to track items and also make it easy to place a bid or ask on items. It's usually easy to find what you are looking for.\nWhen it comes to buying sneakers from StockX, I have had several issues over the years that were rarely rectified. They simply offer you $20 off your next buy to try rectify the situation. I have received damaged boxes, factory issues on sneakers, and even a fake pair of Yeezy QNTM sneakers with the fake receipt included in the box. People basically use StockX to dump grade B pairs of sneakers and they seem to pass.\nTheir support system is a joke. Each time you try to contact them in the app, it creates a new case. There's no way to track a case with them. I had situation recently where I spoke to someone via the chat in their iPhone app, with all the photos they needed and my information. Only to find out they never opened a case for me. If you have any issues (which you will) send them an email with all the details, if you want to get a response to an issue.","title":"Good for selling but don't buy anything\u2026","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=95&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-14","author":"Corin Giff","text":"I bought a pair of Travis Scott Fragment Jordan 1s - they not only did not arrive but after trying to get it sorted for a month StockX have told me they're refusing to even investigate\/talk to UPS about it.

Customer support is non existent. All they are clearly instructed to do is give out random general information and never actually bother to solve the problem, hoping their customer gives up or if they don\u2019t they simply stop replying altogether. This issue has come up again and again. Since august I have been unable to place asks or bids. After contacting them again and again and getting the same irrelevant information, almost 3 weeks ago I tried pushing even harder. They kept saying absolutely nothing useful regarding my issue, were unable to collect any actual data from my account and understand what could be causing it but kept thanking me for bringing up the issue. Mind you, the soonest each heartless pointless reply to my emails was coming 3 days later. Finally, 7 days ago they just stopped replying. Simply stopped. Their last email was, please place another ask or bid (as if I wasn\u2019t already daily) so we can investigate, I instantly replied and haven\u2019t heard from them since. The cases of people having issues with this platform is significantly higher than any other theoretically legitimate business. Find different ways to sell your products. STAY AWAY\n\nUpdate: They we\u2019re pretty quick to reply here. They really wanted the issue resolved. They asked for my info and I gave it to them. 4 more days passed and I finally got a reply. They reply was:\n\nThank you for reaching out about your concern, I am not seeing any restrictions on our end prohibiting you from buying or selling on our platform. Has this been resolved, if not can you please attach a screenshot of the error that you are receiving?\n\nAfter 20 days, this. After tons of screenshots, this. After days of explaining, this. After so much money lost, this.\nA person getting payed to take a 20second look at something and not even bother to look for the template. 2 lines of nothing, thanking me once again for my concern. Who knows maybe in 20 more days someone will ask again if it was solved by itself or maybe, at some point is will get resolved by itself. \n\nSo, their practice is, as far as their customer support is concerned.
