They sent me a different pair of concept Air Max (a more boyish style). My daughter was very upset because she was really looking forward to The concept Mellow\u2019s for our vacation, had outfits picked out and everything. When I contacted customer service (Via Chat) they had me send several pictures as proof that they were wrong. Finally, when they felt the \u201cproof\u201d was satisfying enough they apologized and let me know that someone else would be contacting me from customer service. The Next day I was contacted via email by Austin who gave me two options, and that due to the unique circumstances of the situation and company they couldn\u2019t send me the right sneaker, so either I  return the sneakers for a full refund or take $25 off of the next order I make. After talking it over we decided to take the $25 off even though I felt that it wasn\u2019t really enough, but whatever\u2026so be it . So now I email Austin back our decision, he replies and to add insult to injury he tells me that he sent a code and that I have 90 days to use it. So now I\u2019m on a time limit to order for someone else\u2019s error. I just feel very disregarded and highly disappointed in Stock X.","title":"I brought a pair of Concept air max 1\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=43&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-10","author":"Carol","text":"Took a long time to get my order.
