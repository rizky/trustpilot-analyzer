We do not house an inventory and each item you purchase comes from an individual Seller. Additionally, StockX is an anonymous marketplace, so we cannot facilitate a return with the Seller directly. However if you do have an issue with your product, you can reach out within 3 business days, and we will be happy to review the issue with you. Thank you for your patience and understanding.\u201d\n\nAnother agent wrote\n\n\u201c After looking through your account, I notice your DropX exclusive JBL Freak edition headphones has been delivered. Due to the anonymous nature of our live marketplace, we are unable to offer returns, exchanges, or swaps of any kind - including if you ordered the wrong size. As we are not a regular retail store, we do not hold any inventory.\u201d\n\nPathetic to say the least!!!\n\nEven if you respond in 3 days no luck just from reading other reviews!  No one should ever think of buying from StockX\u2026.never know what you\u2019ll get\u2026.that\u2019s if you get it.

StockX wouldn't honor a refund, and they didn't have enough protection on the package to cover the $339 sale of the shoes.  StockX refused to help in any way at all.  They also DO NOT HAVE A CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE NUMBER, which is outlandish.  I will NEVER use StockX again, as they truly have the worst set up for customer care I have ever witnessed.\nEdit - It has been over a month.  I filed a claim and since StockX purchased the shipping label, I'm not able to even go through with the claim until StockX sends me a release of item for UPS.
