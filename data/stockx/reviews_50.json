I regret that decision. Back in December I ordered the Cool Greys and after 3 weeks, they sat waiting to be verified and never made any movement. StockX was never able to tell me what happened to my shoe. Here I am again in March, I ordered a pair of yeezys. They were estimated to arrive to me and we are now beyond that timeframe. My shoe has been waiting to be verified yet again with no movement in quite some time. This is two times now that I have paid for a shoe and not received it. I understand that delays happen but in both scenarios, I have had to reach out to figure out what is going on. If you are experiencing delays then shouldn\u2019t it be up to you to express that to the customer?
