I opened the box and at first glance, the Nike box appeared off. I did a side-by-side comparison with multiple boxes from Nike.com and no match. The color, tag, and \u201cNike\u201d sign are no match. The left shoe is ripped and the pair do not match one another in regard to stitching and material placement either. There is even a flaw in the stitching of the Nike symbol on the back of one of the shoes. Within the hour of the shoes being delivered to my home, I reached out on the StockX app in an attempt to do what I needed in order to return them and get a refund. You have to first take photos of the shoes and send them in in order to request the return of the item. StockX sent me an email requesting more photos. I emailed the requested photos back to them within the same day. After a few days of waiting to hear back, they tell me after reviewing the photos I sent to them, that the pair of shoes I have passes their authenticity test. This was my first time using this app and will definitely be my last. Such an absolutely pathetic excuse for a platform in place to make people feel comfortable purchasing \"authentic\" items. I will do everything in my power to spread the word to any and everyone I know or come in contact with about how disappointing and ridiculous of a platform this app is. Save yourself time and most importantly the money.
