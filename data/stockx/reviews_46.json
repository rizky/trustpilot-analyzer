Your paypal is rejecting the payment 2. your creditcard company is blocking the payment 3. \u201cwe do not recognize any issues but reset your payment information 4. We recognize the issue but wont do anything about it 5. Recognize the issue will firward to the right department and reset your payment information again. 6 now the app says my region is not correct while I made dozens of purchases with this region\/address.\n\nThey made me reach out to both paypal and the bank twice, the bank even told me stockx was blocking the transaction!
