Scalpers buy what was once cheap and enjoyable goods and sell them at ridiculous prices. They \u201cverify\u201d items and you pay a fee for it, when in reality I bet all they do is look at an item and say it\u2019s good and take your money. I know and I\u2019ve seen multiple people get items from Stock X that were in fact fake. The worst part of stock X is they have a no return policy whatsoever. If you accidentally buy something, you can\u2019t go back. If someone steals your credit card and buys something, you can\u2019t get a refund either which is my case. Stock X is literal scum.\n\nUpdate: Stock X replied below and said they would resolve the issue and give me a refund. That was a lie. I reached out to their support and they said they can\u2019t give me a refund even though the purchase was UNAUTHORIZED. Their suggestion is to sell the item back on their website so they can profit %13\u2026 Another large business screwing over its customers.

I see that it is a new release and as per our policy, the seller has 3 business days to ship the package, which means, everything is on the right track, the seller's \"ship by\" date is the 8th of December (today). Also, please keep in mind that it can take up to 48 hours for the tracking information to update, so please don't be alarmed if you don't see the most up-to-date information immediately.\" So basically I purchased something, then they change their policy back into the past, but still on the webpage it shows me 2 full buisness days. Try to bind me to both purchases now and i need to buy 2 t-shirts. They are basically thiefs!!!
