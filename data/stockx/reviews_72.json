I made the mistake of ordering a handbag from StockX instead of spending a few extra hundred dollars to get it from the store.  I did receive the bag and it did look like it was in new condition and authentic.  However, the bag was supposed to have the pochette and that was not included.  The advertisement shows the pochette and there is no mention that it would not be included.  I have a very difficult time contacting Stockx in regards to this issue.  I relied heavily on reviews of this company before I made the purchase.  While the reviews were pretty good, they weren\u2019t really specific to the handbags.  This company has more of a focus on sneakers\/shoes.  I think the handbag area may be fairly new.  They need to improve in a lot of areas if they want to continue to be a seller of luxury handbags.  The following are concerns I have with the company and reasons to suggest you consider not using them:\n-no phone number to contact anyone with questions or concerns. They have an email option, but that makes it very difficult when\/if you have an issue\n-they don\u2019t show you pictures of the actual bag you will receive.  It is a picture they pull from somewhere online. \n-description for item is very vague and doesn\u2019t necessarily let you know what is\/isn\u2019t included.  \n-I\u2019m not sure how knowledgeable the authenticators of the handbags are as they authenticated my handbag without the pochette.  \n-the prices aren\u2019t necessarily cheap or cheap enough to risk purchasing from an outside company rather then going to the brand name store. In my case I could have spent 400.00 more and wouldn\u2019t have had to question authenticity or deal with the back and forth on the missing pochette. Wasn\u2019t worth it.","title":"luxury handbag buyer beware","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=72&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-22","author":"David","text":"Still haven't received my shoes","title":"Still haven't received my shoes","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=72&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
