I mistakenly ordered the wrong size. Yes my fault. BUT MISTAKES HAPPEN! There is NO RETURN policy with stockX. stockX's solution is to just relist the unwanted pair back on their platform. Problem solved right? Relist it on stockX. More money for stockX, more hassles for the consumer. Lesson learned. eBay is cheaper and easier than stockX... Ohh and they have a return policy too, wild concept. \n\nFollow up: I find it funny that they replied to the above message telling me to just relist it on stockX.

I purchased a pair of the Yeezy cleats in April 2022. My grandson tried them on and put them up for his first game on April 23, he took all the tags off and wore them for the first time on that day.  He played his SECOND game on April 24, (the next day) and in the 4th inning the sole came off the shoe.  \nI contacted Stock X and was told due to me not reporting the issue WITHIN 3 DAYS OF RECIEVING the product, I will not get a refund.  \nHow do you report an issue 3 days after your receive a product when you haven't worn them on the ballfield yet?????  They tore up the 2nd time they were worn at a cost of $239!!!!!\nI sent them pictures of the shoe and they said due to the shoes being HEAVILY ( 1 1\/2 games) worn..... they would not refund but they were giving me $30 towards another purchase.....UMMMMM no thanks, 1st and last time I will deal with them!!!\nThey also wanted pictures of the shoe with the VERIFIED medallion attached to the shoe.... Now I don't know about you all but, I tend to take off stuff like that when I wear it especially running on a ball diamond.....QUESTION???? Did they actually VERIFY them, themselves before they shipped them to me and stole my $239????\n\nBuyers beware... I will only use GOAT for my purchases from now on and I will take every opportunity I can to tell about my experience with STOCK X.\n\n\nUPDATED:  After reading their response, I hope anyone else that is considering a purchase from Stock X will take note that they didn't even address that the product failed after 2 times of being worn.  I also have filed a claim with the BBB in Michigan. \n\nIf the shoes would have simply made it through one season I would not be upset but, 1 full game and 4 innings of another is not what I consider a good product - Right now I consider Stock X thieves of the $239 that I worked hard for.","title":"If I could give no stars","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=22&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"Amy","text":"The shoes I received are fake. 100% certain.
