Great selection, wide range and well categorized. Absolute horrid operations. Really bad quality control and very inconsistent on what gets to the buyer. Gave it two tries, damaged order first time, defective order second time. Useless customer service. First order: told to just pay them more money to use the platform to dump the damaged item on some other poor unexpecting soul. Second order: Didn't bother responding to my ticket.\n\nFrom buyer's perspective: Overall, StockX runs a terrible operation, doesn't seem to care about it's customers and lacks accountability and transparency. Fortunately, those can all be fixed, but it's too late for me. Right now, you're just paying them a fee to put a sticker or tag on the item and wait extra days.","title":"Great platform, but...
