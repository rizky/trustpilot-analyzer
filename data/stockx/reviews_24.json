I communicated with stockx about the problem and was sent an email directing me to follow up in a link that was just a list of FAQ. No solution provided. I sent another email to address the problem and received no reply. Overall a horrible cheating! Stocx receives a payment allegedly to ensure authenticity of the merchandise but does not take any responsibility when the merchandise it sells is fake. I lost 440 cad in a pair of shoes that are a joke. It is a cheating website that legitimizes the fraud of sellers. A totally dismissive approach of stocx which clearly shows that they are not serious but just cheaters. Never ever!\n\u2026.\nReferring to the reply below from Stocx- it is not glues and stitches- but nike logo in insoles is missing and the logo on the side of both shoes is not engraved as the authentic ones. Furthermore you did not provide me any opportunity to explain what is wrong with the shoes and why I believe they are fake- but closed any line of communication. Obviously you have not done your work to properly check what you delivered- regardless of being paid for that and your promise to verify before delivering!","title":"The merchandise sent was fake","stars":1,"location":"CA","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=24&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"james charters","text":"I initially thought I was paying one amount for shoes I bought, however, when the transaction was completed I paid $70 or so more.

A few days later I received an email stating the item had arrived at StockX to be checked. A week passed with no further updates so I looked on the website and was disappointed to discover that the item had not passed the verification process. Their online help section states that, if this happens, they try and match the winning bid with another seller; however, I subsequently received an email stating that they will be refunding my money within 3-7 working days. Whilst the initial customer support I received was excellent, clearly they have not followed company procedure as there are now several of the same item listed on the website for considerably less than what I was prepared to pay. Whilst I appreciate that it\u2019s not their fault that the item couldn\u2019t be verified, they have missed an opportunity to shift a different sellers\u2019 item for quite a bit more than the current listed price. I am now praying that the refund is processed in a timely manner as I have seen the same item offered for sale elsewhere and it would be a shame to miss out twice!","title":"The good, the bad and the ugly","stars":3,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=24&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-25","author":"Matthew","text":"I NEVER RECEIVED MY SHOES!!!
