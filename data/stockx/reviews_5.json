I purchased it FROM an actual Bottega Veneta boutique WITH a receipt. Essentially, I was told that it did not pass the \u201cauthentication\u201d stage because the \u201cdesign\u201d in stitching and a missing logo. Of course questioning this bag (and ignorant to believe StockX), I did my homework and Bottega Veneta swears by their product. After asking for a second reconsideration, Ben (from StockX) stated they will not reconsider authenticating it and will return because it \u201cdifferent than other bags we've seen.\u201d \n\nEvidently, their authenticators either have no experience in the ACTUAL fashion industry or are not up-to-date with products. Therefore, it is interesting how they can \u201cswear\u201d by the fact that you will not receive a fake. Trust me, if something purchased from a boutique is what their calling \u201cfake\u201d (i.e., my situation)\u2026they must not know the difference and you might be purchasing a fake yourself. Be warn! Be careful. This company may seem legit but customer should be questioning who (on their behalf) is authenticating products.\n\nNeedless to say, I am going to go into Bottega Veneta as well because now this whole situation has me second guessing on a $1600 purchase. Could the boutique have sold me a fake? I doubt it, but I am doing my research hard.\n\nSell StockX a fake, they may say it\u2019s real.","title":"I attempted to sell a brand new bag\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=5&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-05","author":"Scott","text":"Stockx does a good job verifying to see if products are real or fake.
