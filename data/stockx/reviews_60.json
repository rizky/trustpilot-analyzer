I ordered the Ash Greys and they come out looking like the Blush colorway. I reached out to them and they refused to let me return the shoes and refund me rather they want me to resell the shoes on their site so they can make more of a profit. I have taken the shoes to 3 separate reseller shops in my town and they all informed me that the shoes are replicas. There is differences in the material (holding it under blacklight to see the flaws), font differences inside the shoe tags and on the box and the box is a different material and color than the authentic ones.\n\nIn response to Stockx\u2019s response I have noticed it is a very generic response sent to anyone who states they\u2019ve received a replica. I do not believe my shoe is inauthentic I KNOW it\u2019s in authentic. Like I stated I\u2019ve taken it to 3 shops to be verified and all stated the shoes are inauthentic.","title":"Stockx has sold me a pair of fake yeezy\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=60&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-30","author":"Snap","text":"Couple dirt spouts that should of been pointed out","title":"Couple dirt spouts that should of been\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=60&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-30","author":"Latoya","text":"Shoes are over priced and takes forever to get \u203c\ufe0f","title":"Shoes are over priced and takes forever\u2026","stars":1,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=60&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-03-30","author":"Sacha J","text":"I ordered and paid for a pair of shoes.

As collectors are aware, the value in Funko PoP's lie in the box and the sticker with both needing to be in mint condition.\n\nAt no point on the listing or anywhere that I can find on the website, there is no mention that it is possible for Funko PoPs to arrive damaged. The picture on the listing is generic as well so buyers are unable to see the condition and the listing stated that the condition was 'New'. The customer service rep that is handling my case tried to refer me to a page regarding trading card boxes ... which was honestly a little insulting but I haven't lost my temper at him yet.\n\nThey are refusing to take back the item and keep insisting on giving me a little discount on my next purchase, hilarious.
