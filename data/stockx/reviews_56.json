Bought a pair of Airforces for a friend of mine and the moment I received it , I noticed the shoes had defects. I immediately submitted a case on  StockX as it is the only way to contact them( which I fond ridiculous as the app is not fully functioning). Just got back a reply saying they apologise but the defects are due to mass production! I am sorry but for the fee you charge you better be doing a good job of inspection and if you are super strict on your refund\/ exchange policy. Why do I have to buy a defected shoe? Ps please so not apologise and send an automated reply on how great your are at inspection and  you feel there are acceptable. If it was yourselves buying these trainers you would  of not accepted such condition but somewhat you expect us to pay for poor quality.","title":"Don\u2019t buy from here","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=56&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-02","author":"Chris Brown","text":"What a garbage company.
