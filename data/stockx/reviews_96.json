I figured I\u2019d cancel my bid afterward. But there was no option to cancel and no chat or customer service phone number  anywhere and before I knew it it had shipped!

The very first reply came in today 09\/11 and the feedback was that refund is not possible due to missing shippment information. Although return shippment ahs been documented and all information has been sent (including return delivery number confirmed by DHL).\n\nAGAIN: be very careful with this company!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  \n\n\nHi Harald, hope you're doing well today.
