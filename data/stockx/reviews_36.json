There has been no updates, no way to understand what's been pending, no place to ask questions and track what's going on. In the confirmation email it says I can expect my shoes to arrive 4\/12-19 but the last email I received was the original seller did not send the shoes to StockX. I checked the Q&A session and it says there is no way to cancel the order. Frankly I would have just cancel the order if it was Ebay or any online purchase platform and buy them somewhere else. It's such a hot item that it would become hard to buy again if I lost the opportunity to bid this week. And yet StockX does not tell me what's happening with my order up til now. Deleted my StockX app already and won't come back anymore. I could have spent this $150 somewhere else and got my pair already.","title":"Terrible Experience","stars":1,"location":"HK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=36&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-04-16","author":"R.
