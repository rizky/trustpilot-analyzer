Either there is creasing or damage on the sneakers already when they are supposed to arrive deadstock, or sometimes they are missing accessories or the box is damaged. There is just always one thing wrong. I have not had this experience with other websites when I purchase them but sometimes more sought after and rare sneakers are only on StockX","title":"I have mixed views on StockX","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=93&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-23","author":"Mitch","text":"i love stockx but the prices and bids are really confusing. plus quality controll Could be better. i want my thing in mint condition. that is not always the case with stockx","title":"i love stockx but the prices and bids\u2026","stars":3,"location":"NL","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=93&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-23","author":"LL","text":"Packing are poor even sneakers or Kaws figure s","title":"Packing are poor even sneakers or Kaws\u2026","stars":3,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=93&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-23","author":"Ehab","text":"Very difficult to get customer service.

However from the product\u2019s condition it is very apparent that the bearbrick is in a used condition. Very scratchy at the foot and body. This is so disappointing where StockX is supposedly a very reputable global platform - consumers will just trust the description at the product page.

They claim to have a rigorous review process to authenticate their merchandise and claim this item passed inspection. When I received it, it was clearly worn, AND the shocking part was the tags had been sewn on the black jacket with brown thread which caught my eye. Upon further inspection, someone had taken a tag from a BROWN hoodie and sewn it onto the black jacket! It clearly says brown on the tag. I immediately filed an online complaint and attached all the pictures as requested on their site. I got a bounce back email with a case number that said it would be resolved in 24 hours and it\u2019s now been four days and they won\u2019t answer my emails.

He's not very well and all stockx have done is made his situation worse. You ought to be ashamed! We don't have any contact details for this company at all, so how on God's earth are we supposed to return these for a refund? Absolute crooks, you're a disgrace and fake.

When I clicked buy now I got this error message saying that an error has occurred try again later something like that. I went to check my bank also stockx - buying section under my account to see if the transaction was successful, just in case. No money was withdrawn, no item showed on stockx page and no confirmation of purchase email received. So I thought the transaction didn't go through, I thought this happened because I'm a first time buyer and from Australia. I tried again few minutes later. Same thing occurred. I googled to see if anyone else had this issue and I found stockx's post on their website that this happens and you can try again few moments later. So I tried few more times as I really had to get those shoes yesterday so I could get them in time. In between I checked my bank and stockx, email - Nothing. At this stage I have given up and was looking for another site to buy from. Then probably half an hour later or so I ended up with 6 transactions with minus balance in my bank and up until that point I still hadn't received any order confirmation email from them. please be aware and I hope people don't make the same mistake I made. I will not buy from them again (I only bought from them as I thought GOAT didn't have the shoes I wanted but they did!)  I will stick to GOAT it is cheaper too - average of $50 cheaper on same product and faster shipping.\n\n* In addition to the above, I got refunded for the 5 additional transactions in error - i didn't have enough fund to cover the FIVE pairs in my bank account so more like the money bounced back with total of $25 bank fees so its not really a refund. Looks bad on my statement, what if I was getting a loan and they looked at this.","title":"I bought a pair of Jordans yesterday\u2026","stars":1,"location":"AU","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=93&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-11-27","author":"Mary Gill","text":"Money was taken from my account for a bid that does not exist or order that does not have a number.
