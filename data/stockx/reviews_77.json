IMAGINE SELLING A HIGH PRICE ITEM AND THESE CLOWNS CLAIM ITS LOST AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT. HOW LAUGHABLE BUT WE WILL DEFINITELY SEE! A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IS PENDING AGAINST STOCKX AND UPS. \n\nSTOCKX CLAIM THEY WANT TO TAKE THEIR COMPANY PUBLIC.

They need to be held to account before more people are scammed and they further ruin the sneaker market.\n\n1) Purchaed fake shoes which they are unwilling to refund.\n\n2) Sold an item and they claim it has gone missing. They have offered no resolution. \n\n3) If you have noticed unusual price fluctuations on their platform. \n\n4) Customer service has not helped in anyway. \n\n5) They have refused a refund even with the item not being as described. \n\n6) Bought a pair of shoes and they began to fall apart. \n\n7) Unauthorised payments taken from your card without confirmation or permission.\n\n8) They have refused a refund even though you have not received your item. \n\n9) Been sent the wrong size and told there is nothing they are going to do. (Stockx will send the wrong size and expect you to resell it on their platform for a lower price whilst taking a further profit from the customer) \n\nIf you have any evidence of these thieving charlatans please email; stockxscam @ gmail.com Please include as much evidence as possible. (Pictures, Screenshots, emails etc) \n\nStock x chargers the seller and buyer fees on the same product.

I am not sure who is validating these shoes, but whoever is needs appropriate training because they clearly don't know what they are doing. they hit me with a fine of $15 which is mind-blowing.
