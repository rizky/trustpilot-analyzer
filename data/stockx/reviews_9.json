I never received a notification stating the initial seller never shipped the shoes. When I reached out to customer service five days after placing the order, they stated that they had issued a refund because the shoes never shipped. Around 3 days after this, I received an email stating that I was connected to another seller, when I was under the impression that I would be receiving a refund. Now the shoes are on the way to me, which is nice because that was the outcome that I had been hoping for, as I didn't want to restart the process if it would be as confusing again. I do appreciate being connected to another seller, however, I would just appreciate some more transparency on my next order. I do plan on continuing to use your services.\n\nThanks","title":"There was no transparency with my order","stars":2,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=9&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2022-05-02","author":"XxX","text":"My order delayed around half month and still have not received it. I paid the high price because I want it asap. If the products are not sent out on time, I think I should have the right of cancelling the order rather than forcing me to accept the delay.\n\nIf the price is fixed, I have no complaints about the delayed shipping.\n\nEven the price is floating but it is shipped on time, I would not have any complaints too.\n\nThe point is the price of the products on StockX are mostly floating. I paid the high price because I want it asap and I cannot wait until the price become stable. What is the point of I paying a higher price and still got the product at the same time of ppl who paying a lower price? Really disappointed.

Unfortunately, this meant I needed to drive nearly 20 minutes one way to get the package within a 2hr time window. The box had seen better days and there was barely any packaging material inside the box to protect the item. Luckily, the item only had minor damage to the box (corners are damaged) and some shelf wear. If this was a rare collectable the shipping method\/protection would have been unacceptable. At the end of the day the item was new, as promised and I got a small discount over retail. However, with the hassle of dealing with delivery restrictions I'm not sure I'll shop stockx for items available at retail that can be delivered to my front door and in more secure packaging.","title":"I received the package within the\u2026","stars":3,"location":"US","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=9&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"}]
