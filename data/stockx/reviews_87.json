Within one month there's been 3 sales failing verification because 'item does not match listing'. I mainly deal with designer clothing and sneakers and it's a known fact one product style can carry different serial numbers due to re-releases, carry overs from past seasons, different manufacturing batches etc. \n\nThe verification process used to be smooth without many problems. Somehow within this month their 'authenticators' had taken a different approach of just matching items according to that one serial number listed without using any common sense, or having understanding of the brand and styles they are working with. I've sold Palm Angels t shirts from the same batch number on StockX before without any issue, and all of a sudden the latest sale got rejected because the serial number doesn't match the listing? Does your staff have any clue that the style gets re-released? What is going on?!?! \n\nAlso have noticed that multiple listings for the very same product has been appearing on StockX. Search Palm Angels Logo Print T Shirt Black VS Palm Angels Classic Logo Print T Shirt. They're both the same crewneck style that Palm Angels had manufactured for multiple seasons now!! \nI've used another app called POIZON to buy & sell before, I've pretty much lost interest in listing stuff to sell on there because these muppets have overpopulated their app with duplicate listings of the same product, all due to some rigid principle that they only verify through serial numbers. I can't imagine shopping on there with all sorts of duplicates presented as if they're all different products.\n If StockX is trying to replicate this approach then I highly suggest you not; this is the ultimate user experience fail which will lead to more confusion for both buyers & sellers alike, a super messy f'ed up interface and loss of any organization. The logic MAKES. NO. SENSE. And most of all you're wasting my time, effort and money in the process!\nAnd by the way, the items returned to me are now sent from Mainland China, which takes twice as long to get back to me. I am absolutely appalled at what my recent selling experience had been.","title":"Verification service took a nosedive overnight","stars":2,"location":"HK","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=87&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-19","author":"Amy Knudsen","text":"We bought a pair of shoes, which we received and were charged for.

However this item came all in one piece unlike the jordan 11 so congrats.\n \n13601444-13501203\nFair enough you weren\u2019t to know about the broken box but tbh I just didn\u2019t see the worth if I all I get is after 2 emails I just get ignored for weeks upon end. Unlike goat.\n\nCrazy I planning on buying a pair of dunks from you within then next 2 weeks for my girlfriend. That\u2019s more money I\u2019m giving which is such a waste. What do you even use that commission on lol you should literally maybe spend it on auto response to respond at least they don\u2019t take a week to respond and actually respond and not ignore for months on end now do they. \n \nSelling \n \n12961865-12861624\n\nNow my first sale tbh I wasn\u2019t as knowledgeable about selling on stock x which meant I actually sold for very little profit lol however I do know how to read a box and a US shoe size on a box. As if I would ever get a 14 lol I won a 13 US Uk12 but for some reason your site thought it was a 14 tbh can\u2019t expect much tbh I was using your website which is ten times worst than your app. The amount of times I have been the lowest ask and still not sold despite the item selling for more than me the lowest ask lol \ud83e\udd26. Now also when I sold on the website literally in December last year I sold like 3 items and received notifications for them on the app but it never even delisted. Or ever got on the sale page it\u2019s as if it just sent the notification to trick me it was for the dunk disrupt black\n \n14974227-14873986\nAh another size problem so I\u2019m not sure if you guys didn\u2019t know the sizing of the yeezy slide as tbh back then it was brand new however the sizing is the same both ways a uk12 is a us12. Not only that but you had the completely wrong size guide on site until I pointed it out and got support to put in a. Request to change it and correct it. This sizing problem I notice happens on kids shoes ALOT miss match sizing also you sometimes have sizes which literally don\u2019t exist like how can a toddler jordan 1 uni blue have a 1Y lol. Don\u2019t worry KLEKT often have this problem however seems like they are leading the pack with customer experience goes. \n\n15133937-15033696\nRight so this one probably one of the. Most stressful ones. I sold the shoe great I had the shoe double great however we was in a nation wide lockdown and it was illegal to leave house other than groceries essentially I\u2019m not taking a \u00a310000 fine for nobody when the army are patrolling the streets. So I requested and rightly so an alternative shipping. Label for home collection don\u2019t worry I will cover the cost for the collection lol. Anyway that fell apart with your agents taking days to get back to me then they gave me a shipping extension when lol there wasn\u2019t any shipping extension even thought I received an email for one I told the advisor and he said he is sorry the shipping extension didn\u2019t work as. I never got one. I had to go back and collect the item from the drop off before get sent it as in the end I did risk it breaking. The law for you. \n \n15161823-15061582\nOk probably the most funniest literally the company who made the item laughed on the chat. Palace tri hoodie I got one from\nDiver street market and one from palace I sent the palace one to you in the palace packaging with the palace receipt. Then it took a week to authenticate I actually messaged saying this is taking too long then boom verification failed. I literally sent a screen shot to palace who then laughed on the email with emojis yeah a chat agent using emojis stating how authentic do they need these days. Lol considering it came straight from the manufacture that\u2019s real worrying on your behalf I have heard you authenticate fakes and now fail legitimates ( although thank god I never have received fakes from you otherwise that would literally just make this 10 times. Than it already is.) \n \nSo yeah I am owed way more than $24 in compensation so either refund me or compensate after asking for 2 years now lol I have proof.","title":"The audacity","stars":1,"location":"GB","url":"https:\/\/www.trustpilot.com\/review\/stockx.com?page=87&stars=1&stars=2&stars=3"},{"date":"2021-12-20","author":"Mrkay kay","text":"If It would allow me id rate stock x -1 I sold a pair of shoes which I dropped of at UPS access point and it never updated Now shoes are lost and stock x is saying they don not cover them because it wasn\u2019t dropped of a designated UPS location however all the UPS drop offs with 10 miles of where I live are UPS access points!
